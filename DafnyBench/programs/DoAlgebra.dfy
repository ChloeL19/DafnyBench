HumanEvalX 160 
Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and the second list is a 
list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric expression and return the evaluation of 
this expression. The basic algebra operations: Addition ( + ) Subtraction ( - ) Multiplication ( * ) 
Floor division ( // ) Exponentiation ( ** ) Example: operator['+', '*', '-'] array = [2, 3, 4, 5] 
result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 => result = 9 Note: The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand 
list minus one. Operand is a list of of non-negative integers. Operator list has at least one operator, 
and operand list has at least two operands.
