Task description: fill in the algorithm and supporting annotations such that the provided formal specification verifies. Note the formal spec may rely on helper functions in its expression. The LLM may be expected to generate helper functions in order to solve the problem.

* *Category 1*: The model only needs to fill in one function based on formal spec completely contained within the ensures/requires clauses of the function. [Example]
* *Category 2*: The model needs to fill in one or more helper functions in addition to the core method and/or the formal specification for the model's task relies on one or more helper functions.
