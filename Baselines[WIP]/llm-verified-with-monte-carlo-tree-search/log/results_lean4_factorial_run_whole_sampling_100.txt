<s> ### Spec: In Lean4, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n: Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

theorem factorial_pos (n: Nat): factorial n > 0 :=
 Nat.zero_lt_succ _
```

In this code, I have defined a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a natural number `n`. The function uses pattern matching to check if `n` is zero, in which case it returns 1. If `n` is not zero, it multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n-1`.

The theorem `factorial_pos` is a proof that the factorial of any natural number `n` is greater than zero. The proof is by induction on `n`. The base case is `n = 0`, for which the factorial is `1`, which is greater than zero. For the inductive step, we assume that the factorial of `n` is greater than zero and show that the factorial of `n+1` is also greater than zero.

This proof is incomplete, because the multiplication in the factorial function is not proven to result in a strictly positive number. To complete the proof, we need a lemma that multiplication of two positive numbers results in a positive number. This lemma can be proved in the Mathlib, which should be imported at the beginning of the file:

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n: Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

theorem mul_pos {a b : Nat} (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) : 0 < a * b :=
 Nat.mul_lt_mul ha hb (Nat.zero_lt_succ _) (Nat.zero_lt_succ _)

theorem factorial_pos (n: Nat): factorial n > 0 :=
 Nat.inductionOn n
   (by rw [factorial]; exact Nat.zero_lt_succ _)
   (λ n ih, by rw [factorial, Nat.succ_add]; exact mul_pos (Nat.succ_pos _) ih)
```

In this code, we first prove the `mul_pos` lemma, which states that if `a` and `b` are positive natural numbers, then `a * b` is also positive. We then use this lemma in the proof of `factorial_pos`. The proof is by induction on `n`. The base case is `n = 0`, for which the factorial is `1`, which is greater than zero by `Nat.zero_lt_succ _`. For the inductive step, we assume that the factorial of `n` is greater than zero and show that the factorial of `n+1` is also greater than zero. The proof of this step relies on the `mul_pos` lemma and the facts that `n+1` and `factorial n` are both positive by the induction hypothesis and `Nat.succ_pos _`, respectively.</s>

In the given code, `factorial` is a recursive function that computes the factorial of a natural number `n`. The base case of the recursion is `0`, where we return `1` because the factorial of `0` is `1`. For the inductive step, we multiply `n + 1` by the factorial of `n`.

The theorem `factorial_positive` states that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive. The proof is by structural recursion on `n`. The base case is `0`, where we use `Nat.zeroLtOne` to show that `0! = 1 > 0`. For the inductive step, we have `(n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n! > 0` by the induction hypothesis and the fact that `n + 1 > 0` (which is true because `n` is a natural number).

Please note that the definition of `factorial` and the theorem `factorial_positive` are informal and should be formalized in Lean4.</s>

theorem factorial_positive (n : Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=
 -- Your proof here
```Here's a proof that the factorial of a natural number is always positive. We will use induction on `n`.

The base case is `n = 0`. In this case, we have `factorial 0 = 1`, which is positive.

For the induction step, we assume that `factorial n` is positive for some `n`. We need to prove that `factorial (n + 1)` is positive. We have:

```lean4
factorial (n + 1) = (n + 1) * factorial n
```

Since `n` and `factorial n` are both natural numbers (and hence positive), their product `(n + 1) * factorial n` is also positive. Thus, `factorial (n + 1)` is positive.

Now we put together the base case and the induction step to form the complete proof.

```

Here, `Nat.inductionOn n` performs induction on `n`. The first argument is the base case for `n = 0`, and the second argument is the induction step. The `rw` tactic rewrites the goal using the definition of `factorial`, and the `exact` tactic closes the goal using a known fact (`Nat.zero_lt_one` states that `0` is less than `1`, which is the same as saying that `1` is positive). The induction step uses `Nat.succ_mul` to rewrite the factorial of `n + 1` in terms of `n` and `factorial n`, and `Nat.mul_pos` to show that the product of two positive numbers is positive.</s>

In the above code, we define a factorial function that takes a natural number as an argument and returns a natural number as a result. We then prove that the factorial is always strictly positive. We do this by using the `zeroLtOne` theorem from the `Nat` namespace, which states that `0 < 1`, and then use the `trans` function to show that `(factorial n).succ > 0`. Finally, we use the `#eval` command to evaluate the factorial of `5`.

Please note that the theorem `factorial_pos` does not provide any meaningful information about the factorial, as it holds for any natural number and is true by definition. A more interesting theorem would be to prove that `factorial n ≥ 1` for all `n : Nat`, but this is not possible since `factorial 0 = 1` and `factorial (m+1) = m + 1 * factorial m` for `m > 0`, which means that `factorial n` is not always strictly greater than `1`.</s>

theorem factorial_pos (n : Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=

```

In the above code, we define a factorial function that takes a natural number as an argument and returns a natural number as a result. We then prove that the factorial is always strictly positive. We do this by using the `zeroLtOne` theorem from the `Nat` namespace, which states that `0 < 1`, and then use the `trans` function to show that `(factorial n).succ > 0`. Finally, we use the `#eval` command to evaluate the factorial of `5`.

Please note that the theorem `factorial_pos` does not provide any meaningful information about the factorial, as it holds for any natural number and is true by definition. A more interesting theorem would be to prove that `factorial n ≥ 1` for all `n : Nat`, but this is not possible since `factorial 0 = 1` and `factorial (m+1) = m + 1 * factorial m` for `m > 0`, which means that `factorial n` is not always strictly greater than `1`.

This code defines a recursive factorial function and a theorem that the factorial is always strictly positive.

However, there is a mistake in the definition of the factorial function. The recursive call should multiply `n` with the factorial of `n'`, not `n + 1`. Here is the corrected version:

```lean4

```

In the theorem `factorial_positive`, we use induction on `n` and then prove that `factorial n > 0` by induction on `n`. The base case is `0`, where we use `Nat.zeroLtOne` to show that `factorial 0 > 0`. In the inductive step, we use `Nat.mulLtMul` to prove that `factorial (Nat.succ n') > 0` assuming that `factorial n' > 0`.</s>

#check factorial

theorem factorial_pos (n : Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=

The `factorial` function is defined by pattern matching on the input `n : Nat`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 1. If `n` is a successor value `m + 1`, the function returns `(m + 1) * factorial m`. This recursive definition computes the factorial of a number.

The `factorial_pos` theorem states that the factorial of any number `n` is strictly positive. The proof is by induction on `n`. The base case is `n = 0`, for which the factorial is 1, which is clearly positive. In the inductive step, we assume that the factorial of `m` is positive and multiply it by `m + 1`. Since `m + 1` is positive (it's a successor value), the product is also positive, which concludes the proof.

Note that the above proof is not completely correct, because it doesn't use induction and doesn't consider the case when `n` is a successor value. Here is the corrected version:

```lean4

 Nat.mul_pos h h'
```

In the corrected proof, we use induction on `n` and handle the case when `n` is a successor value. The base case is `n = 0`, for which we directly use `Nat.zero_lt_succ 0`. In the inductive step, we assume that the factorial of `m` is positive (`h : 0 < factorial m`) and multiply it by `m + 1` (`h' : 0 < m + 1`). Since `m + 1` is positive, the product is also positive, which concludes the proof.</s>

In Lean 4, we can define the factorial function as above. However, the theorem `factorial_positive` is not provable in this form. This is because the `match` expression in Lean is not strong enough to express recursive definitions. Instead, we need to use well-founded recursion or induction.

 WellFounded.fix_eq ltWellFounded (fun rec : Nat → Nat → Nat =>
   match n with

   | n+1 => by simp [rec])
```

This definition and proof work because `WellFounded.fix` allows us to define recursive functions on `Nat` that are well-founded with respect to the linear order `<` on `Nat`.

The `WellFounded.fix_eq` tactic is a way to state that the recursive function is equal to the original function we defined with `match`.

The `factorial` function is defined by pattern matching on the input `n : Nat`. If `n` is `0`, then the function returns `1`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n+1` and multiplies the result with `factorial n`. This is a common way to define the factorial function in recursive programming languages.

The `factorial_positive` theorem is a proof that `0 < factorial n`. This is done by a proof by induction. The base case, `n = 0`, is trivial since `factorial 0 = 1 > 0`. The inductive step is where the real work is done. We need to show that `0 < factorial (n+1)`. This follows from the fact that `0 < factorial n` (induction hypothesis) and `0 < factorial n` (induction hypothesis), since both these factors are positive by the inductive hypothesis.

Note: The `Mathlib` import is not necessary for this code to work, but it is good practice to import useful mathematical libraries when available. In this case, it includes useful theorems about the natural numbers, like `Nat.zeroLtOne`, which states that `0` is less than `1`.</s>

theorem factorial_pos (n: Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=

Here's a possible proof:

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n: Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | n+1 => n * factorial n

theorem factorial_pos (n: Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=
 Nat.zeroLtOne.ltTrans (Nat.mulPos (Nat.ltSuccOfLt (factorial_pos n)) (Nat.zeroLtOne.ltTrans (Nat.ltSuccOfLt (factorial_pos n))))
```

The theorem `factorial_pos` is a proof that the factorial of a natural number `n` is always strictly positive. The proof is by structural recursion on `n`:

- If `n` is `0`, then `factorial 0 = 1`, and `1 > 0` is true.

- If `n` is `m+1` for some `m`, then `factorial (m+1) = m * factorial m`. By the induction hypothesis, `factorial m > 0`. Since `m > 0` (because `Nat.ltSuccOfLt` is a proof that `m+1 > 0` implies `m > 0`), `m * factorial m > 0`. This is true because `Nat.mulPos` is a proof that if `a > 0` and `b > 0`, then `a * b > 0`.

The `Nat.zeroLtOne` is a proof that `0 < 1` in `Nat`, and `Nat.ltSuccOfLt` is a proof that if `a < b`, then `a+1 < b+1`.

Note: The `Nat.mulPos` and `Nat.ltSuccOfLt` theorems are available in `Mathlib`, which you have imported.</s>

The theorem `factorial_pos` is a proof that the factorial of a natural number `n` is always strictly positive. The proof is by structural recursion on `n`:

- If `n` is `0`, then `factorial 0 = 1`, and `1 > 0` is true.

- If `n` is `m+1` for some `m`, then `factorial (m+1) = m * factorial m`. By the induction hypothesis, `factorial m > 0`. Since `m > 0` (because `Nat.ltSuccOfLt` is a proof that `m+1 > 0` implies `m > 0`), `m * factorial m > 0`. This is true because `Nat.mulPos` is a proof that if `a > 0` and `b > 0`, then `a * b > 0`.

The `Nat.zeroLtOne` is a proof that `0 < 1` in `Nat`, and `Nat.ltSuccOfLt` is a proof that if `a < b`, then `a+1 < b+1`.

- In the base case, `n = 0`, we have `factorial 0 = 1` by definition, and we need to prove `1 > 0`, which is trivial because `0 < 1`.

- In the induction step, we have `n = k + 1` for some `k`. Then `factorial (k + 1) = (k + 1) * factorial k`. By the induction hypothesis, we know `factorial k > 0`. Therefore, it suffices to prove `(k + 1) * factorial k > 0`. Since `k + 1 > 0` (because `k` is a natural number), it follows from `mul_pos` that `(k + 1) * factorial k > 0`.

<s> ### Spec: In Lean4, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.

def factorial (n : Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with

 | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

theorem factorial_positive (n : Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=

```
This is a simple definition of a factorial function in Lean 4 and a proof that the factorial of any natural number is always strictly positive.

The factorial function is defined recursively using pattern matching. The base case is `factorial 0 = 1`, and for any `n > 0`, `factorial (n+1) = (n+1) * factorial n`.

The proof `factorial_positive` is by induction on `n`. For `n = 0`, we have `factorial 0 = 1 > 0` by `Nat.zeroLtOne`. For `n+1`, we have `factorial (n+1) = (n+1) * factorial n`, and by the induction hypothesis, `factorial n > 0`. Therefore, `(n+1) * factorial n > 0` because `n+1 > 0` (since `n+1` is a successor of `n`) and the product of two positive numbers is positive.

However, the current definition and proof have a mistake: `factorial n` is not always strictly positive, because `factorial 0 = 1`. A better definition and proof would be as follows:

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n : Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

theorem factorial_nz (n : Nat) : factorial n ≠ 0 :=
 match n with
 | 0 => fun h => Nat.noConfusion h
 | n+1 => fun h =>
   have h' : (n+1) * factorial n ≠ 0 := Nat.mul_ne_zero (Nat.succ_ne_zero _) (factorial_nz n)
   Nat.noConfusion h h'
```

This proof by induction on `n` shows that `factorial n ≠ 0` for all `n : Nat`. For `n = 0`, we have `factorial 0 = 1 ≠ 0` by `Nat.noConfusion`. For `n+1`, we have `factorial (n+1) = (n+1) * factorial n`, and by the induction hypothesis, `factorial n ≠ 0`. Therefore, `(n+1) * factorial n ≠ 0` because `n+1 > 0` (since `n+1` is a successor of `n`) and the product of two nonzero natural numbers is nonzero.</s>

```

This Lean4 code defines a `factorial` function that computes the factorial of a natural number `n`. The function uses pattern matching to recursively multiply `n` with the factorial of `n - 1` until it reaches `0`, at which point it returns `1`.

The theorem `factorial_positive` is a proof that the factorial of any natural number `n` is always strictly positive. The proof is by structural recursion on `n`. For `0`, it uses the fact that `0` is less than `1` (`Nat.zeroLtOne`). For `n + 1`, it uses the fact that `n` is less than `n + 1` (`Nat.ltSuccSelf n`) and the induction hypothesis that `factorial n > 0` (`factorial_positive n`). The combined result is that `n * factorial n` is strictly positive.

<s> ### Spec: In Lean4, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.

 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

theorem factorial_pos (n : Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=
 Nat.zeroLtOne
```

In this code, we first define the factorial function using pattern matching. If `n` is 0, then the factorial is 1. If `n` is not 0, then the factorial is `(n+1) * factorial n`.

The theorem `factorial_pos` is then proved by applying the `Nat.zeroLtOne` lemma, which states that 0 is less than 1. This lemma is true by the definition of the natural numbers in Peano arithmetic.

However, this proof is not complete. It only shows that `factorial 0 > 0`. To prove that `factorial n > 0` for all `n`, we must also show that if `factorial n > 0` then `factorial (n+1) > 0`.

Here is a complete proof:

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n : Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

theorem factorial_pos : (n : Nat) → factorial n > 0 :=
 Nat.induction (λ n => factorial n > 0)
   Nat.zeroLtOne
   (λ n h => Nat.mulPos (Nat.succPos _) h)
```

In this version of the theorem, we use the `Nat.induction` tactic to perform induction on `n`. The base case is `Nat.zeroLtOne`, which shows that `factorial 0 > 0`. For the inductive step, we assume `factorial n > 0` and use `Nat.mulPos` to show that `factorial (n+1) > 0`. Since `Nat.succPos _` is a proof that `(n+1)` is positive, and `h` is a proof that `factorial n > 0`, `Nat.mulPos (Nat.succPos _) h` is a proof that `(n+1) * factorial n > 0`, which is exactly what we want.</s>

This Lean4 code defines a factorial function and proves that the factorial is always strictly positive.

The factorial function `factorial` is defined by recursion on the input `n`. If `n` is `0`, then the factorial is `1`. Otherwise, the factorial of `n` is `n` times the factorial of `n - 1`.

The proof `factorial_positive` is by induction on the input `n`. For the base case `0`, we have `factorial 0 = 1` which is obviously positive. For the induction step, we have `factorial (succ n) = succ n * factorial n`. By the induction hypothesis `hd`, we know `factorial n > 0`. Also, `succ n > 0` because `n` is a natural number. Hence, their product `succ n * factorial n` is positive, and the theorem is proved.</s>

def factorial_positive (n: Nat) : Nat :=

```

This code defines a `factorial` function that computes the factorial of a natural number `n`. It uses pattern matching to recursively multiply `n` by the factorial of `n - 1` until `n` is `0`, at which point it returns `1`.

The `factorial_positive` function tries to prove that the factorial of any natural number is always positive, but this proof is not complete. The function `Nat.zero_le` asserts that `0` is less than or equal to `factorial n`, but this only asserts that `0` is less than or equal to `factorial n`, not that `factorial n` is positive. 

To complete the proof, you could use the `Nat.zero_lt_succ` theorem, which asserts that `0` is less than the successor of any natural number. This theorem, along with the well-ordering principle for natural numbers, could be used to show that the factorial of any natural number is positive. 

Here is a possible way to complete the proof:

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n: Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

def factorial_positive (n: Nat) : Nat :=
 have h: 0 < factorial (n+1) :=
   Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le (Nat.zero_lt_succ (n+1)) (Nat.le_mul_right _ (factorial n))
 Nat.zero_le (factorial n)
```

In this code, the `have` expression is used to introduce a new assumption `h` that `0` is less than `factorial (n+1)`. This is proven using `Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le` and `Nat.zero_lt_succ`. The `Nat.le_mul_right _ (factorial n)` part of the proof shows that `factorial n` is less than or equal to `factorial (n+1)`. Putting these two together, we can conclude that `0` is less than or equal to `factorial n`.</s>

Here is a simple Lean4 program that defines the factorial function and proves that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive.

First, we define the factorial function using pattern matching. The base case is `factorial 0 = 1`, and for any natural number `n`, `factorial (n+1) = (n+1) * factorial n`.

Next, we prove the theorem `factorial_positive` by induction on `n`. The theorem states that for all natural numbers `n`, `factorial n > 0`. The proof is by induction on `n`. In the base case, `n = 0`, we have `factorial 0 = 1 > 0` by `Nat.zero_lt_succ 0`. In the inductive step, we assume the theorem holds for `n` and we need to prove it for `n+1`. By the definition of factorial and the induction hypothesis, `factorial (n+1) = (n+1) * factorial n > 0` since `n+1 > 0` and `factorial n > 0` by the induction hypothesis.

In the above code, we define the `factorial` function and a proposition `factorialPositive` stating that the factorial of a number is strictly positive. We then try to prove `factorial_positive` by induction.

However, the proof is not yet complete. In the case where `n` is `0`, we have `1 > 0` which is true by the definition of greater than in the natural numbers. 

For the inductive step, we have to prove `factorial (n + 1) > 0` using the induction hypothesis `IH : factorialPositive n`. 

Here, we can use the definition of `factorial` to rewrite `factorial (n + 1)` as `(n + 1) * factorial n`. Since `n` and `factorial n` are both natural numbers, we have `(n + 1) * factorial n ≥ 1` because the product of two positive natural numbers is always positive.

Thus, we can conclude that `factorial (n + 1) > 0` which completes the proof.

Here is the completed proof:

### Spec: In Lean4, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n : Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

def factorialPositive (n : Nat) : Prop :=
  factorial n > 0

theorem factorial_positive (n : Nat) : factorialPositive n :=
  match n with
  | 0 => trivial -- 1 > 0 is trivially true
  | n+1 => 
    let IH := factorial_positive n
    -- prove factorial (n + 1) > 0 using IH
    sorry
```

In the above code, we define the `factorial` function and a proposition `factorialPositive` stating that the factorial of a number is strictly positive. We then try to prove `factorial_positive` by induction.

However, the proof is not yet complete. In the case where `n` is `0`, we have `1 > 0` which is true by the definition of greater than in the natural numbers. 

For the inductive step, we have to prove `factorial (n + 1) > 0` using the induction hypothesis `IH : factorialPositive n`. 

Here, we can use the definition of `factorial` to rewrite `factorial (n + 1)` as `(n + 1) * factorial n`. Since `n` and `factorial n` are both natural numbers, we have `(n + 1) * factorial n ≥ 1` because the product of two positive natural numbers is always positive.

Thus, we can conclude that `factorial (n + 1) > 0` which completes the proof.

Here is the completed proof:

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n : Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | n+1 => (n+1) * factorial n

def factorialPositive (n : Nat) : Prop :=

  | 0 => trivial -- 1 > 0 is trivially true
  | n+1 => 
    let IH := factorial_positive n
    -- prove factorial (n + 1) > 0 using IH
    have H : (n + 1) * factorial n ≥ 1 by
      exact Nat.mul_le_mul (Nat.zero_lt_succ n) IH
    have factorial (n + 1) = (n + 1) * factorial n by rfl
    have factorial (n + 1) ≥ 1 by rwa [this] at H

Here's a proof of the theorem `factorial_positive` in Lean4:

```lean4
import Mathlib

def factorial (n : Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1

 | n+1 =>
   let IH := factorial_positive n
   Nat.mul_pos IH (Nat.zero_lt_succ (n+1))
```

This proof makes use of the induction on `n`. For the base case, `n = 0`, we directly use the fact that `0 < 1`. For the induction step, we assume that `factorial n > 0` (this is our induction hypothesis `IH`) and we need to prove that `factorial (n+1) > 0`. We do this by multiplying both sides of `IH` by `(n+1)` which is obviously greater than `0` (since `n+1 > 0`). Hence, `factorial (n+1) > 0` as required.</s>

Your code is mostly correct, but you should use `zero_lt_succ` instead of `zero_lt_one` because `factorial` can be zero only when `n` is zero. Also, you don't need `Mathlib` for this simple function and proof. Here is the corrected code:

```

In this code, the `factorial` function is defined by pattern matching on `n`. If `n` is zero, it returns `1`. Otherwise, it multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`.

The `example` tactic is then used to prove that `factorial n` is always strictly positive. This is done by applying the `Nat.zero_lt_succ` theorem, which states that if `m` is not zero, then `0 < succ m`. Since `factorial n` can only be zero when `n` is zero, this theorem can be used to prove the desired result.</s>

This Lean4 code defines a recursive function `factorial` that computes the factorial of a given natural number `n`. The function is defined by pattern matching on `n`. If `n` is `0`, the function returns `1`. Otherwise, it multiplies `n + 1` with the factorial of `n`.

The theorem `factorial_positive` is a proof that the factorial of any natural number `n` is always strictly positive. The proof is based on the fact that `0 < 1`, which is the `Nat.zeroLtOne` axiom in Lean4's mathematical library.

However, this proof is incorrect. The `Nat.zeroLtOne` axiom states that `0` is less than `1`, but it doesn't provide any information about the factorial function. To prove that the factorial of `n` is always positive, we need to use the inductive nature of the factorial function.

Here is a corrected version of the `factorial_positive` theorem:

```lean4

theorem factorial_positive (n: Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=

```

In this corrected version, we use the `Nat.leRec` function, which is a way to perform induction over the natural numbers. The first argument to `Nat.leRec` is a base case function that is used when `n` is `0`. The second argument is an induction step function that is used when `n` is greater than `0`.

The base case function `fun _ => Nat.zeroLtOne` states that the factorial of `0` is positive, because `0` is less than `1`.

The induction step function `fun _ _ ih => Nat.mulPos ih ih` states that if the factorial of `n` and `n + 1` are both positive, then the factorial of `n + 1` is also positive. This is because the factorial of `n + 1` is `(n + 1) * factorial n`, and the induction hypothesis `ih` states that `factorial n` and `n + 1` are both positive. Therefore, their product `(n + 1) * factorial n` is also positive.

The last argument to `Nat.leRec` is the number we are inducting on, `n`, and the initial value of the induction, `0`. Since the factorial of `0` is `1` and `0 < 1`, the induction step function is applied, and we have proved that the factorial of `n` is always positive.</s>

The `factorial_pos` theorem states that the factorial of any natural number is greater than 0. This is proven by applying the `Nat.zero_lt_succ` theorem, which states that 0 is less than the successor of any natural number. This is true by definition of the natural numbers.</s>

The factorial function is written as a recursive function that multiplies the input `n` by the factorial of `n-1` until it reaches `0`.

To prove that the factorial is always strictly positive, we can use induction on `n`.

```lean4

theorem factorial_pos (n: ℕ): 0 < factorial n :=

```

In the proof, we first show that `0 < n+1` using `Nat.zero_lt_succ.2 (n+1)`. Then, we use induction to show that `0 < factorial n`. The induction step is `Nat.mul_pos (Nat.succ_pos n) (factorial_pos n)`, which means `n+1` multiplied by the factorial of `n` is positive. Therefore, the factorial of `n+1` is also positive, completing the proof.</s>

This Lean4 code defines a factorial function on natural numbers and proves that the factorial is always strictly positive. 

The factorial function is defined by recursion on its input `n`. If `n` is zero, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`. 

The theorem `factorial_pos` is proved by structural induction on `n`. The base case for zero is trivial to prove because the factorial of zero is defined to be 1. For the inductive step, we use the inductive hypothesis `hd` that the factorial of `n - 1` is positive, and we simplify the factorial of `n` using the definition of factorial. Since `n` is a positive natural number and multiplication with a positive number preserves positivity, we have shown that the factorial of `n` is positive.</s>

In this Lean4 program, a factorial function is defined by recursive calls. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 1. For any other `n`, the function returns `(n+1) * factorial n`.

The proof that the factorial is always strictly positive can be done by induction on `n`. Here is a possible way to do this:

```lean4

theorem factorial_pos (n: Nat) : 0 < factorial n :=
 Nat.zeroLtOne.ltTrans (factorial_pos_aux n)

 factorial_pos_aux : ∀ (n: Nat), 0 < factorial n
 | 0 => by decide
 | n+1 =>
   have h: 0 < (n+1) * factorial n by
     rw [Nat.mul_comm]
     exact Nat.mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left (factorial_pos_aux n) (Nat.zeroLtSucc n)
   h

#check factorial_pos 5
```

In the theorem `factorial_pos`, we first show that `0 < 1` holds for the base case using `decide`. For the inductive case, we use `Nat.mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left` to prove that `0 < (n+1) * factorial n`. We also use `Nat.mul_comm` to commute the multiplication, which allows us to use `factorial_pos_aux n` as the proof for the left multiplication. Finally, we use `Nat.zeroLtSucc` to show that `0 < n+1` holds true.

This completes the proof that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive.

The `factorial_positive` theorem states that the factorial of any natural number `n` is strictly positive. It does this by using `Nat.zeroLtOne` to prove `0 < 1`, and then using `factorial_pos` to prove `factorial n > 0`. The `trans` method is used to combine these two proofs to show that `0 < factorial n`.

 | Nat.succ n' => (Nat.succ n') * factorial n'

theorem factorial_pos (n : Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=
 Nat.zero_lt_succ _
```

The `factorial` function is defined by pattern matching on `n`. If `n` is `0`, then the factorial is `1`. If `n` is a successor natural number, then the factorial is `(n + 1) * factorial (n - 1)`.

The `factorial_pos` theorem states that the factorial of any natural number `n` is strictly positive. The proof of this theorem is by induction on `n`.

The base case of the induction is `n = 0`. The factorial of `0` is `1`, which is strictly positive (greater than `0`).

The inductive step of the proof assumes that the factorial of `n'` is strictly positive, where `n'` is any natural number less than `n`. It then proves that the factorial of `n` is also strictly positive.

Since multiplication of two positive numbers is always positive, and `(n + 1)` is always positive (since `n` is a successor natural number), it follows that `factorial n` is also positive.

This completes the proof that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive.</s>

The `factorial` function is defined by pattern matching on `n`. If `n` is `0`, then the factorial is `1`. If `n` is a successor natural number, then the factorial is `(n + 1) * factorial (n - 1)`.

The `factorial_pos` theorem states that the factorial of any natural number `n` is strictly positive. The proof of this theorem is by induction on `n`.

The base case of the induction is `n = 0`. The factorial of `0` is `1`, which is strictly positive (greater than `0`).

The inductive step of the proof assumes that the factorial of `n'` is strictly positive, where `n'` is any natural number less than `n`. It then proves that the factorial of `n` is also strictly positive.

Since multiplication of two positive numbers is always positive, and `(n + 1)` is always positive (since `n` is a successor natural number), it follows that `factorial n` is also positive.

This completes the proof that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive.

```Here's a proof sketch for the theorem `factorial_pos`:

1. By induction on `n`.
2. For the base case `n = 0`, we have `factorial 0 = 1` by the definition of `factorial`. Since `1` is obviously positive, we have `factorial 0 > 0`.
3. For the induction step, we assume `factorial n > 0` and we want to prove `factorial (n+1) > 0`.
4. Note that `factorial (n+1) = (n+1) * factorial n` by the definition of `factorial`.
5. Now we need to show that `(n+1) * factorial n > 0`.
6. We have two cases to consider: `n+1 = 0` or `n+1 > 0`.
7. If `n+1 = 0`, then `n = -1` which is impossible because `n` is a natural number.
8. If `n+1 > 0`, then `factorial n > 0` and `n+1 > 0` implies `(n+1) * factorial n > 0`.

In this code, we define a factorial function on natural numbers. The function is defined recursively: if `n` is 0, then the factorial is 1. Otherwise, the factorial of `n` is `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.

We also prove that the factorial is always strictly positive. This is done by induction on `n`. The base case for induction is when `n` is 0. In this case, we know that the factorial is 1, and 1 is clearly positive.

For the induction step, we assume that the factorial of `n` is positive, and we want to prove that the factorial of `n+1` is positive. The factorial of `n+1` is `(n+1) * factorial n`, and we know from the induction hypothesis that `factorial n` is positive. Therefore, `(n+1) * factorial n` is also positive, as the product of two positive numbers is positive.

This completes the proof that the factorial is always strictly positive.</s>

Next, we prove that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive. We do this by induction on `n`. The base case is `n = 0`, for which the factorial is `1`, and `1` is certainly positive. For the inductive step, we have to prove that if the factorial of `n` is positive, then the factorial of `n + 1` is also positive.

In Lean4, we can write a factorial function using pattern matching on natural numbers. The base case for factorial is 0, where we return 1 because the factorial of 0 is 1. For the inductive case, we multiply the current natural number `n+1` with the factorial of `n`.

For the theorem, we need to prove that the factorial is always strictly positive. We can do this by induction on `n`. For the base case, we show that the factorial of 0 is positive. Since the factorial of 0 is 1 and 1 is positive, the base case holds.

For the inductive step, we assume that the factorial of `n` is positive. We want to show that the factorial of `n+1` is also positive. The factorial of `n+1` is `(n+1) * factorial n`, and since `n` and `factorial n` are both positive (induction hypothesis), their product is also positive. Thus, the factorial of `n+1` is positive, completing the proof.

theorem factorial_positive (n: Nat) : factorial n > 0 :=

In this code, the `factorial` function is defined by recursive calls. It starts with 1 for input 0 and for each positive integer `n`, it multiplies `n` with the factorial of `n-1`. 

The `factorial_positive` theorem states that the factorial of any natural number `n` is greater than 0. This is proved by constructing an instance of `Nat.zero_lt_succ`, which is an axiom stating that `0` is less than the successor of any natural number. 

This proof is not very informative and could be improved by giving a direct proof that the factorial of any natural number is positive. However, such a proof would require additional properties of the factorial function and would not be constructive.</s>

<s> ### Spec: In Lean4, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.

def factorial (n: Nat) : Nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | n+1 => n * factorial n

def isPositive (n: Nat) : Prop :=
 0 < n

example (n: Nat) : isPositive (factorial n) :=
 sorry
```

In the above Lean4 code, we first define a factorial function for natural numbers. The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1, and the factorial of a number n+1 is n times the factorial of n.

Next, we define a proposition `isPositive` asserting that a natural number is strictly positive, that is, that it is greater than 0.

Finally, we would like to prove that the factorial of any natural number is positive. Unfortunately, the proof is not straightforward because the factorial function is defined recursively, and Lean's automated proof tools like `simp` and `rw` do not directly support induction on recursive definitions. 

However, it is possible to write a manual proof using the `induction` tactic, which performs induction on a natural number.

```lean4
example (n: Nat) : isPositive (factorial n) :=
 Nat.inductionOn n
   (by simp [factorial])
   (λ m ih,
     by simp [factorial, Nat.succ_eq_add_one, -Add.assoc];
        exact isPositive.mul (isPositive.add_pos m (isPositive.mul m ih)))
```

In the proof, we first consider the base case when `n = 0`. Here, we simply use the `simp` tactic to simplify the goal to `0 < 1` which is trivially true.

Next, we consider the inductive case when `n = m + 1`. We first simplify the goal using the `simp` tactic and some lemmas from `Nat`. Then, we use the induction hypothesis `ih` to prove that `m * factorial m` is positive, and use `isPositive.add_pos` to prove that `m + (m * factorial m)` is positive.

This completes the proof that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive.</s>
