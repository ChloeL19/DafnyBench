You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: sfirstorder 


## Context

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.

 [INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: sfirstorder 


## Context
### Need to show

Datatypes.length (fst (unzip (a :: l'))) =
Datatypes.length (a :: l') /\
Datatypes.length (snd (unzip (a :: l'))) =
Datatypes.length (a :: l')

### given assumptions

A, B, a, l', IHl' as follows.

A : Type
B : Type
a : (A * B)%type
l' : list (A * B)
IHl' : Datatypes.length (fst (unzip l')) =
Datatypes.length l' /\
Datatypes.length (snd (unzip l')) =

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: hauto

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: sfirstorder 


## Context
### Need to show

Datatypes.length (x :: xs') =
Datatypes.length (y :: ys')

### given assumptions

x, y, l', xs', ys', IHl' as follows.

x, y : nat
l' : list (nat * nat)
xs', ys' : list nat
IHl' : Datatypes.length xs' = Datatypes.length ys'.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: sfirstorder 


## Context
### Need to show

S (Datatypes.length l1) = S (Datatypes.length l')

### given assumptions

a, b, l', l1, l2, IHl' as follows.

a, b : nat
l' : list (nat * nat)
l1, l2 : list nat
IHl' : Datatypes.length (fst (l1, l2)) =
Datatypes.length l'.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: hauto lq: on 


## Context
### Need to show

Datatypes.length

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

CHOSEN SOLUTION

 [INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: sfirstorder 


## Context
### Need to show

Datatypes.length (fst (unzip (p :: l'))) =
Datatypes.length (p :: l') /\
Datatypes.length (snd (unzip (p :: l'))) =
Datatypes.length (p :: l')

### given assumptions

p, l', IHl' as follows.

p : (nat * nat)%type
l' : list (nat * nat)
IHl' : Datatypes.length (fst (unzip l')) =
Datatypes.length l' /\
Datatypes.length (snd (unzip l')) =
Datatypes.length l'.
