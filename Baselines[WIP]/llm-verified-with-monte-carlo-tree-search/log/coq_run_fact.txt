You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thouroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

### Spec: In Coq, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.
### Hint: Don't forget to import the Arith module.
### Hint: use `Nat.lt_0_1` in the base case of the proof.
### Hint: use `Nat.lt_lt_add_r` in the inductive case of the proof.

```coq
From Coq Require Import Arith.

Fixpoint factorial (n: nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | S n' => n * factorial n'
  end.

Lemma factorial_positive : forall n, 0 < factorial n.
Proof.
  intros n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
