(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `unzip` that takes a list of pairs and returns a pair of lists, where the first element is a list of all the first elements of the original list, and the second elemens is a list of all the second elements of the original list.
(2) Then write a lemma that proves that the length of the lists in the returned pair of `unzip` are the same as the length of the original list.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.
