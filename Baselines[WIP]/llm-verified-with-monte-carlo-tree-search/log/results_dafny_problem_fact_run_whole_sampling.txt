This Dafny program defines a factorial function, `Factorial`, and proves that the factorial of any natural number is always strictly positive. The proof uses a simple induction on the input `n`. The base case handles `n = 0`, where it is trivial to show that `Factorial(0) = 1 > 0`. The inductive step assumes the result holds for `n - 1`, and then shows that `n * Factorial(n - 1)` is also positive.</s>

Here is a Dafny program that defines a factorial function and proves that the factorial is always strictly positive. 

The factorial function is defined as a plain function, not a function method. The argument and return type of the function is nat, not int.

This program uses induction to prove the lemma. The base case for induction is when n equals 0, where we directly prove that Factorial(0) is 1, which is greater than 0. In the inductive step, we assume that Factorial(n - 1) is greater than 0, and then we prove that Factorial(n) is also greater than 0.</s>

In this Dafny program, we define a factorial function that takes a natural number as an input and returns a natural number as an output. The function is defined recursively: the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of a non-zero number n is n times the factorial of n-1.

The lemma FactorialPositive is a proof that the factorial of any natural number is always strictly positive. This is proved by induction on n. The base case (n = 0) is straightforward: 1 is obviously positive. For the inductive step, we use the recursive definition of the factorial to break down the problem into a smaller subproblem (proving that the factorial of n-1 is positive), and then we simply multiply both sides of the inequality by n, which preserves the direction of the inequality.</s>

In this code, the function `Factorial` computes the factorial of a given `nat` number `n`. The lemma `FactorialPositive` is proved by induction on `n`. The base case of the induction is `n = 0`, where `Factorial(0) = 1` which is obviously positive. In the inductive step, we use the induction hypothesis that `Factorial(n - 1) > 0`. Then `Factorial(n) = n * Factorial(n - 1)` is positive because both `n` and `Factorial(n - 1)` are positive. Thus, we have proved that the factorial of any `nat` number is strictly positive.</s>

This Dafny program defines a factorial function on the natural numbers. The function is defined by recursion: the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of a positive natural number n is n times the factorial of (n-1).

The lemma FactorialPositive is a proof that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive. The proof is also by induction: the base case is trivial (the factorial of 0 is 1, which is positive), and the inductive step is to show that if the factorial of (n-1) is positive, then the factorial of n is also positive. This follows from the definition of the factorial.</s>

In this Dafny program, we define a factorial function that takes a natural number as an input and returns a natural number as an output. The function is defined recursively: the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of a non-zero number n is n times the factorial of n-1.

The lemma FactorialPositive is a proof that the factorial of any natural number is always strictly positive. This is proved by induction on n. The base case (n = 0) is straightforward: 1 is obviously positive. For the inductive step, we use the recursive definition of the factorial to break down the problem into a smaller subproblem (proving that the factorial of n-1 is positive), and then we simply multiply both sides of the inequality by n, which preserves the direction of the inequality.
