In this Coq script, we first define a `factorial` function that computes the factorial of a natural number `n`. This function is defined by recursion on `n`: the base case is `0 => 1`, and the inductive case is `S n' => n * factorial n'`.

Then we prove `factorial_pos`, which states that the factorial of any natural number `n` is strictly positive.

The `factorial` function is defined as a recursive function on `nat`. The base case is when `n` is `0`, it returns `1`. In the inductive case, `n` is `S n'`, so it returns `n * factorial n'`.

The `factorial` function is defined as a recursive function on `nat`. The base case is when `n` is `0`, it returns `1`. In the inductive case, `n` is `S n'`, so it returns `n * factorial n'`.

The `factorial_pos` theorem states that for all `nat` values `n`, `0` is less than `factorial n`. The proof is by induction

['\n```\n\nThis Coq script defines a factorial function on natural numbers, and proves that the factorial is always strictly positive.']
CHOSEN SOLUTION
### Spec: In Coq, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.
### Hint: Don't forget to import the Arith module.
### Hint: use `Nat.lt_0_1` in the base case of the proof.
### Hint: use `Nat.lt_lt_add_r` in the inductive case of the proof.

```coq
Require Import Arith.

Fixpoint factorial (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | S n' => n * factorial n'
  end.

Theorem factorial_pos : forall n, 0 < factorial n.
Proof.
  intros n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - simpl.
    apply Nat.lt_0_1.
  - simpl.
    apply Nat.lt_lt_add_r.
    apply IHn'.
Qed.
