You are a Coq programming assistant. You will be given some code and an error. Your goal is to write a few sentences to explain why the is wrong as indicated by the error. You will need this as guidance when you try again later. Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation.

Lemma RepeatLength : forall x n, Length (repeat x n) = n.
```

The error is:
Error: The reference Length was not found in the current environment.
in the snippet:
Lemma RepeatLength : forall x n, Length

[/INST]

The error occurs because the reference "Length" was not found in the current environment. This is likely because the "Length" function from the standard library is not in scope. To fix this issue, you need to import the required module that contains the "Length" function.

In this case, you should import the "List" module from the standard library, which contains the "Length" function for lists. You have already imported the "List" module, but the error persists because the "Length" function is actually in the "ListNotations" module. You need to import this module as well.

Here is the corrected code:

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.



You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

The error is:

Fixpoint repeat (x : int)

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".</s>

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

y = x

### given assumptions

x, y, H as follows.

x, y : nat
H : In y (repeat x 0).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (1) Define the function `repeat` *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : int)

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' y

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros H. inversion H. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - intros H.

The error is:

The error occurs because the variable `z` is not in the context of the goal after the `induction` tactic.

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

## Context
### Need to show

### given assumptions

x, y, H as follows.

x, y : nat
H : In y (repeat x 0).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (1) Define the function `repeat` *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : int)

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' y

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros H. inversion H. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - intros H.
    generalize (IHn' y H).
    induction H as [|z IHn' z In_repeat].
    - (* Case: y = x *) reflex

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' z

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `z` is not in the context of the goal after the `induction` tactic. The `induction` tactic introduces new variables, and in this case, it introduces `z` and `In_repeat` as new variables. However, the `generalize` tactic is trying to generalize over `z`, which is not in the context.

To fix this error, you should first generalize over `In_repeat` and then use the generalized variable in the induction hypothesis. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' y

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros H. inversion H. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - intros H.
    generalize (IHn' y H).
    induction H as [|z IHn' z In_repeat].
    - (* Case: y = x *) reflex

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' z

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `z` is not in the context of the goal after the `induction` tactic. The `induction` tactic introduces new variables, and in this case, it introduces `z` and `In_repeat` as new variables. However, the `generalize` tactic is trying to generalize over `z`, which is not in the context.

To fix this error, you should first generalize over `In_repeat` and then use the generalized variable in the induction hypothesis. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

y = x

### given assumptions

x, n', y, IHn', H as follows.

x, n', y : nat
IHn' : In y (repeat x n') -> y = x
H : In y (repeat x (S n')).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (1) Define the function `repeat` *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : int)

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' y

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros H. inversion H. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - intros H.
    generalize (IHn' y H).
    induction H as [|z IHn' z In_repeat].
    - (* Case: y = x *) reflex

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' z

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `z` is not in the context of the goal after the `induction` tactic. The `induction` tactic introduces new variables, and in this case, it introduces `z` and `In_repeat` as new variables. However, the `generalize` tactic is trying to generalize over `z`, which is not in the context.

To fix this error, you should first generalize over `In_repeat` and then use the generalized variable in the induction hypothesis. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (1) Define the function `repeat` *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : int)

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' y

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros H. inversion H. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - intros H.
    generalize (IHn' y H).
    induction H as [|z IHn' z In_repeat].
    - (* Case: y = x *) reflex

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' z

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `z` is not in the context of the goal after the `induction` tactic. The `induction` tactic introduces new variables, and in this case, it introduces `z` and `In_repeat` as new variables. However, the `generalize` tactic is trying to generalize over `z`, which is not in the context.

To fix this error, you should first generalize over `In_repeat` and then use the generalized variable in the induction hypothesis. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

y = x

### given assumptions

x, n', y, IHn', H as follows.

x, n', y : nat
IHn' : In y (repeat x n') -> y = x
H : In y (repeat x (S n')).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (1) Define the function `repeat` *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : int)

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' y

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros H. inversion H. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - intros H.
    generalize (IHn' y H).
    induction H as [|z IHn' z In_repeat].
    - (* Case: y = x *) reflex

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' z

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `z` is not in the context of the goal after the `induction` tactic. The `induction` tactic introduces new variables, and in this case, it introduces `z` and `In_repeat` as new variables. However, the `generalize` tactic is trying to generalize over `z`, which is not in the context.

To fix this error, you should first generalize over `In_repeat` and then use the generalized variable in the induction hypothesis. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.

(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.

IHn' : In y (repeat x n') -> y = x
H : In y (repeat x (S n')).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (1) Define the function `repeat` *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : int)

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' y

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros H. inversion H. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - intros H.
    generalize (IHn' y H).
    induction H as [|z IHn' z In_repeat].
    - (* Case: y = x *) reflex

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `z` is not in the context of the goal after the `induction` tactic. The `induction` tactic introduces new variables, and in this case, it introduces `z` and `In_repeat` as new variables. However, the `generalize` tactic is trying to generalize over `z`, which is not in the context.

To fix this error, you should first generalize over `In_repeat` and then use the generalized variable in the induction hypothesis. Here's the corrected proof script:

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

y = x

### given assumptions

x, n', y, IHn', H as follows.

x, n', y : nat
IHn' : In y (repeat x n') -> y = x
H : In y (repeat x (S n')).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (1) Define the function `repeat` *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : int)

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the type "int" was not found in the current environment. In Coq, the type for integers is called "nat" (short for natural numbers), not "int". So, to fix this error, you should replace "int" with "nat" in the definition of the function "repeat".

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' y

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is of the form `In y (repeat x n') -> y = x`, but the induction hypothesis should be generalized with a fresh variable instead of `y`. The correct way to generalize is to introduce a fresh variable `z` and then rewrite the goal using this fresh variable.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros H. inversion H. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - intros H.
    generalize (IHn' y H).
    induction H as [|z IHn' z In_repeat].
    - (* Case: y = x *) reflex

### Snippet
generalize (IHn' z

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `z` is not in the context of the goal after the `induction` tactic. The `induction` tactic introduces new variables, and in this case, it introduces `z` and `In_repeat` as new variables. However, the `generalize` tactic is trying to generalize over `z`, which is not in the context.

To fix this error, you should first generalize over `In_repeat` and then use the generalized variable in the induction hypothesis. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `simpl` tactic to simplify the goal before applying `reflexivity`. Here's the corrected proof script:

```Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
 intros x n.
 induction n as [|n' IHn'].
 - reflexivity. (* Base case: n = 0 *)
 - simpl. reflexivity. (* Step case: n = S n' *)

To fix this error, you need to change the goal of your lemma to match the induction hypothesis. You can do this by changing the goal to `In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')`. Here's the corrected lemma statement and proof:

Coq
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n').
Proof.

You are a Coq programming assistant. You will be given some code and an error. Your goal is to write a few sentences to explain why the is wrong as indicated by the error. You will need this as guidance when you try again later. Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation.

(* (1) Define the `repeat` function *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with

The error is:

in the snippet:
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')

[/INST]

The error occurs because the variable `n'` is not defined in the statement of the lemma `elements_repeat`. It seems like the lemma should state that for any `y`, if `y` is an element of `repeat x n`, then `y` is an element of `repeat x n'`. However, `n'` is not quantified in the statement of the lemma, so Coq does not know what it is. To fix this error, you should add `n'` as a parameter to the lemma:

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

    assumption.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is not applicable in the current context. The `In` predicate is not the same as the `=` equality relation. The `In` predicate is a way to check if an element is in a list, while `=` is a way to check if two values are equal.

To fix this error, you should use the `In` predicate in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].

    apply IHn' in H.
    rewrite H.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

### Snippet
apply IHn'

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a different goal from what you are trying to prove. The induction hypothesis states that if `In y (repeat x n')` is true, then `y = x`. However, you are trying to apply this induction hypothesis to the goal `x = y`, which is not the same.

To fix this error, you need to change the goal of your lemma to match the induction hypothesis. You can do this by changing the goal to `In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')`. Here's the corrected lemma statement and proof:

Coq
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n').
Proof.

It seems like the lemma should state that for any `y`, if `y` is an element of `repeat x n`, then `y` is an element of `repeat x n'`.

To fix this error, you need to change the goal of your lemma to match the induction hypothesis. You can do this by changing the goal to `In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')`. Here's the corrected lemma statement and proof:

Coq
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n').
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `n'` is not defined in the statement of the lemma `elements_repeat`. It seems like the lemma should state that for any `y`, if `y` is an element of `repeat x n`, then `y` is an element of `repeat x n'`. However, `n'` is not quantified in the statement of the lemma, so Coq does not know what it is. To fix this error, you should add `n'` as a parameter to the lemma:

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a different goal from what you are trying to prove. The induction hypothesis states that if `In y (repeat x n')` is true, then `y = x`. However, you are trying to apply this induction hypothesis to the goal `x = y`, which is not the same.

To fix this error, you need to change the goal of your lemma to match the induction hypothesis. You can do this by changing the goal to `In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')`. Here's the corrected lemma statement and proof:

Coq
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n').
Proof.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `n'` is not defined in the statement of the lemma `elements_repeat`. It seems like the lemma should state that for any `y`, if `y` is an element of `repeat x n`, then `y` is an element of `repeat x n'`. However, `n'` is not quantified in the statement of the lemma, so Coq does not know what it is. To fix this error, you should add `n'` as a parameter to the lemma:

Coq
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros contra.
    inversion contra.
  - intros contra.
    inversion contra.
    apply IHn' in H.
    rewrite H.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a different goal from what you are trying to prove. The induction hypothesis states that if `In y (repeat x n')` is true, then `y = x`. However, you are trying to apply this induction hypothesis to the goal `x = y`, which is not the same.

To fix this error, you need to change the goal of your lemma to match the induction hypothesis. You can do this by changing the goal to `In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')`. Here's the corrected lemma statement and proof:

Coq
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n').
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `n'` is not defined in the statement of the lemma `elements_repeat`. It seems like the lemma should state that for any `y`, if `y` is an element of `repeat x n`, then `y` is an element of `repeat x n'`. However, `n'` is not quantified in the statement of the lemma, so Coq does not know what it is. To fix this error, you should add `n'` as a parameter to the lemma:

However, you are trying to apply this induction hypothesis to the goal `x = y`, which is not the same.

To fix this error, you need to change the goal of your lemma to match the induction hypothesis. You can do this by changing the goal to `In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')`. Here's the corrected lemma statement and proof:

Coq
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n').
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  induction n as [

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma: `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x` *)
Lemma elements_repeat : forall x n y, In y (repeat x n) -> In y (repeat x n')

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `n'` is not defined in the statement of the lemma `elements_repeat`. It seems like the lemma should state that for any `y`, if `y` is an element of `repeat x n`, then `y` is an element of `repeat x n'`. However, `n'` is not quantified in the statement of the lemma, so Coq does not know what it is. To fix this error, you should add `n'` as a parameter to the lemma:

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is not applicable in the current context. The `In` predicate is not the same as the `=` equality relation. The `In` predicate is a way to check if an element is in a list, while `=` is a way to check if two values are equal.

To fix this error, you should use the `In` predicate in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported.

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

The error occurs because the "induction" tactic in Coq requires an argument. In this case, it seems like the argument is missing after "induction". The correct usage should be something like "induction n" or "induction n'", depending on the specific goal.

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

### Snippet
q_dec

### Reflection

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Lists.In_dec.


After importing the In_dec module, the error should be resolved, and you can continue with the proof.

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'.

However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

y = x

### given assumptions

x, n', IHn', y, H as follows.

x, n' : nat
IHn' : forall y : nat, In y (repeat x n') -> y = x
y : nat
H : In y (repeat x (S n')).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
q_dec

### Reflection

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Lists.In_dec.


After importing the In_dec module, the error should be resolved, and you can continue with the proof.

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

### Snippet
induction n
  -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "induction" tactic in Coq requires an argument. In this case, it seems like the argument is missing after "induction". The correct usage should be something like "induction n" or "induction n'", depending on the specific goal.

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    + reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y

### Snippet
destruct H

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `H` is not in the context of the current goal. In the `destruct H` line, `H` is expected to be a proof of a membership relation `In y (repeat x n')`, but it is not in the context.

To fix this error, you need to first prove that `y` is in `repeat x n'` before you can destruct `H`. You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y

### Snippet
destruct (In_repeat

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "In_repeat" is not defined in the current environment. The "In_repeat" term is not a valid constructor for the "In" predicate. The "In" predicate is defined for the "list" type, and it has two constructors: "In_nil" and "In_cons".

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.

You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y

### Snippet
destruct (In_repeat

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "In_repeat" is not defined in the current environment. The "In_repeat" term is not a valid constructor for the "In" predicate. The "In" predicate is defined for the "list" type, and it has two constructors: "In_nil" and "In_cons".

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

After importing the In_dec module, the error should be resolved, and you can continue with the proof.

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

The error occurs because the variable `H` is not in the context of the current goal. In the `destruct H` line, `H` is expected to be a proof of a membership relation `In y (repeat x n')`, but it is not in the context.

To fix this error, you need to first prove that `y` is in `repeat x n'` before you can destruct `H`. You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y

### Snippet
destruct (In_repeat

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "In_repeat" is not defined in the current environment. The "In_repeat" term is not a valid constructor for the "In" predicate. The "In" predicate is defined for the "list" type, and it has two constructors: "In_nil" and "In_cons".

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `destruct` tactic is used on a term that is not an inductive definition. The term `In y (repeat x n')` is a proposition, not an inductive definition. The `In` function is a standard library function that checks if an element is in a list, and it is not an inductive definition.

To prove the lemma `repeat_content`, you should use the `induction` tactic on the `In` function instead. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term `In y (repeat x n')` is not an inductive definition and thus cannot be used with the `induction` tactic. The `In` function is a standard Coq function for testing membership in a list, and it is not an inductive type. Instead, you should use the `destruct` tactic to decompose the `In` function.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Lists.In_dec.


After importing the In_dec module, the error should be resolved, and you can continue with the proof.

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

### Snippet
induction n
  -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "induction" tactic in Coq requires an argument. In this case, it seems like the argument is missing after "induction". The correct usage should be something like "induction n" or "induction n'", depending on the specific goal.

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    + reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

### Snippet
induction n
  -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "induction" tactic in Coq requires an argument. In this case, it seems like the argument is missing after "induction". The correct usage should be something like "induction n" or "induction n'", depending on the specific goal.

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    + reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.

### Snippet
destruct H

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `H` is not in the context of the current goal. In the `destruct H` line, `H` is expected to be a proof of a membership relation `In y (repeat x n')`, but it is not in the context.

To fix this error, you need to first prove that `y` is in `repeat x n'` before you can destruct `H`. You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq

Proof.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "In_repeat" is not defined in the current environment. The "In_repeat" term is not a valid constructor for the "In" predicate. The "In" predicate is defined for the "list" type, and it has two constructors: "In_nil" and "In_cons".

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq

The `In` function is a standard library function that checks if an element is in a list, and it is not an inductive definition.

To prove the lemma `repeat_content`, you should use the `induction` tactic on the `In` function instead. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

### Reflection

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Lists.In_dec.


After importing the In_dec module, the error should be resolved, and you can continue with the proof.

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

### Snippet
induction n
  -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "induction" tactic in Coq requires an argument. In this case, it seems like the argument is missing after "induction". The correct usage should be something like "induction n" or "induction n'", depending on the specific goal.

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    + reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].

### Snippet
destruct H

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `H` is not in the context of the current goal. In the `destruct H` line, `H` is expected to be a proof of a membership relation `In y (repeat x n')`, but it is not in the context.

To fix this error, you need to first prove that `y` is in `repeat x n'` before you can destruct `H`. You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "In_repeat" is not defined in the current environment. The "In_repeat" term is not a valid constructor for the "In" predicate. The "In" predicate is defined for the "list" type, and it has two constructors: "In_nil" and "In_cons".

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.

The `In` function is a standard library function that checks if an element is in a list, and it is not an inductive definition.

To prove the lemma `repeat_content`, you should use the `induction` tactic on the `In` function instead. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

### given assumptions

x, y : nat
H : In y (repeat x 0).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Lists.In_dec.


After importing the In_dec module, the error should be resolved, and you can continue with the proof.

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "induction" tactic in Coq requires an argument. In this case, it seems like the argument is missing after "induction". The correct usage should be something like "induction n" or "induction n'", depending on the specific goal.

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    + reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `H` is not in the context of the current goal. In the `destruct H` line, `H` is expected to be a proof of a membership relation `In y (repeat x n')`, but it is not in the context.

To fix this error, you need to first prove that `y` is in `repeat x n'` before you can destruct `H`. You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.

The error occurs because the term "In_repeat" is not defined in the current environment. The "In_repeat" term is not a valid constructor for the "In" predicate. The "In" predicate is defined for the "list" type, and it has two constructors: "In_nil" and "In_cons".

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

The error occurs because the `destruct` tactic is used on a term that is not an inductive definition. The term `In y (repeat x n')` is a proposition, not an inductive definition. The `In` function is a standard library function that checks if an element is in a list, and it is not an inductive definition.

To prove the lemma `repeat_content`, you should use the `induction` tactic on the `In` function instead. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term `In y (repeat x n')` is not an inductive definition and thus cannot be used with the `induction` tactic. The `In` function is a standard Coq function for testing membership in a list, and it is not an inductive type. Instead, you should use the `destruct` tactic to decompose the `In` function.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.

The error occurs because the `destruct` tactic is used on a term that is not an inductive definition. The term `In y (repeat x n')` is a proposition, not an inductive definition. The `In` function is a standard library function that checks if an element is in a list, and it is not an inductive definition.

To prove the lemma `repeat_content`, you should use the `induction` tactic on the `In` function instead. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term `In y (repeat x n')` is not an inductive definition and thus cannot be used with the `induction` tactic. The `In` function is a standard Coq function for testing membership in a list, and it is not an inductive type. Instead, you should use the `destruct` tactic to decompose the `In` function.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

### Snippet
q_dec

### Reflection

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Lists.In_dec.


After importing the In_dec module, the error should be resolved, and you can continue with the proof.

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

### Snippet
induction n
  -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "induction" tactic in Coq requires an argument. In this case, it seems like the argument is missing after "induction". The correct usage should be something like "induction n" or "induction n'", depending on the specific goal.

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    + reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].

### Snippet
destruct H

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `H` is not in the context of the current goal. In the `destruct H` line, `H` is expected to be a proof of a membership relation `In y (repeat x n')`, but it is not in the context.

To fix this error, you need to first prove that `y` is in `repeat x n'` before you can destruct `H`. You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y

### Snippet
destruct H

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `H` is not in the context of the current goal. In the `destruct H` line, `H` is expected to be a proof of a membership relation `In y (repeat x n')`, but it is not in the context.

To fix this error, you need to first prove that `y` is in `repeat x n'` before you can destruct `H`. You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Proof.

### Snippet

The error occurs because the term "In_repeat" is not defined in the current environment. The "In_repeat" term is not a valid constructor for the "In" predicate. The "In" predicate is defined for the "list" type, and it has two constructors: "In_nil" and "In_cons".

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq

To prove the lemma `repeat_content`, you should use the `induction` tactic on the `In` function instead. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

The error occurs because the term `In y (repeat x n')` is not an inductive definition and thus cannot be used with the `induction` tactic. The `In` function is a standard Coq function for testing membership in a list, and it is not an inductive type. Instead, you should use the `destruct` tactic to decompose the `In` function.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y

### Snippet
destruct (In_repeat

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "In_repeat" is not defined in the current environment. The "In_repeat" term is not a valid constructor for the "In" predicate. The "In" predicate is defined for the "list" type, and it has two constructors: "In_nil" and "In_cons".

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y H. inversion H.
  - intros y.
    destruct (In y

### Snippet
destruct (In y (repeat x n')).

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `destruct` tactic is used on a term that is not an inductive definition. The term `In y (repeat x n')` is a proposition, not an inductive definition. The `In` function is a standard library function that checks if an element is in a list, and it is not an inductive definition.

To prove the lemma `repeat_content`, you should use the `induction` tactic on the `In` function instead. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y H. inversion H.
  - intros y.
    induction (In y (repeat x

### Snippet
induction (In y (repeat x n')) as [H1 | H2].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term `In y (repeat x n')` is not an inductive definition and thus cannot be used with the `induction` tactic. The `In` function is a standard Coq function for testing membership in a list, and it is not an inductive type. Instead, you should use the `destruct` tactic to decompose the `In` function.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].

(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.

### Snippet
q_dec

### Reflection

The error occurs because the In_dec.eq_dec reference is not found in the current environment. This is likely because the In_dec module, which provides the eq_dec function for decidability of equality on the In predicate, is not imported. To fix this issue, you should import the In_dec module by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Lists.In_dec.


After importing the In_dec module, the error should be resolved, and you can continue with the proof.

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to destruct an hypothesis of the form "P x" where P is a property (like "In" in this case) and x is a variable. However, in this case, the hypothesis H is not of this form. Instead, it is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "inversion" tactic cannot be used directly on this hypothesis.

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In" property using the "destruct" tactic, and then use the "inversion" tactic on the resulting hypothesis. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction

### Snippet
inversion H as [H1 | H2].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "inversion" tactic is being used incorrectly. The "inversion" tactic is used to break down a hypothesis that is a disjunction (a "or" statement) into two cases. However, the hypothesis "H" in this case is not a disjunction, but rather a membership relation "In y (repeat x n)".

To prove the lemma "repeat_content", you can use the "destruct" tactic instead of "inversion". The "destruct" tactic can be used to break down a hypothesis that is a constructor (like "In" in this case) into its components. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    -

### Reflection

The error message "Error: [Focus] Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished." indicates that there is a problem with the "destruct" tactic in the proof script. The "destruct" tactic is used to break down a term into its components, but it seems to be used incorrectly here.

The "destruct" tactic is applied to a term of the form "P or Q" or "exists x, P" and generates two subgoals, one for each disjunct. In this case, the term "H" is not of the required form.

The "H" term comes from the hypothesis of the lemma, which is of the form "In y (repeat x n)". The "In" function is defined for lists, so "H" is probably a hypothesis of the form "y ∈ repeat x n".

To fix this error, you should first destruct the "In"

### Snippet
induction n
  -

### Reflection

The error occurs because the "induction" tactic in Coq requires an argument. In this case, it seems like the argument is missing after "induction". The correct usage should be something like "induction n" or "induction n'", depending on the specific goal.

### Snippet
destruct H as [H1 | H2].
    + reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis IHn' is not applicable to the case where y is not equal to x. In the case where n is not 0 (n' in the induction hypothesis), the list repeat x n' has x as its head, and if y is in this list, then y must be equal to x by the induction hypothesis IHn'. However, the case where y is equal to x is handled separately, so there is no need to use the induction hypothesis in this case. The correct version of the proof should handle the case where y is not equal to x separately.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y.
  generalize dependent y.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y

### Snippet
destruct H

### Reflection

The error occurs because the variable `H` is not in the context of the current goal. In the `destruct H` line, `H` is expected to be a proof of a membership relation `In y (repeat x n')`, but it is not in the context.

To fix this error, you need to first prove that `y` is in `repeat x n'` before you can destruct `H`. You can do this by applying the `In_repeat` lemma, which states that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x` or `y` is in `repeat x n'`. You can then destruct this lemma to get the required information about `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_content : forall x n, forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.
  intros x n y

### Snippet

To prove the "repeat_content" lemma, you should use the "In" predicate with its constructors "In_nil" and "In_cons". Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment.

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

Here's the corrected proof for the second lemma:

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement.

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma: Length of the list returned by repeat is n *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
apply IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

Here's the corrected proof for the second lemma:

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma: Length of the list returned by repeat is n *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
apply IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

Here's the corrected proof for the second lemma:

Coq

Proof.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
apply IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

Here's the corrected proof for the second lemma:

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma: Length of the list returned by repeat is n *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

### Need to show

length (repeat x 0) = 0

### given assumptions

x as follows.

x : nat.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma: Length of the list returned by repeat is n *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
apply IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

Here's the corrected proof for the second lemma:

Coq

Proof.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

(* (2) Lemma: Length of the list returned by repeat is n *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

Here is the corrected proof:

(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma: Length of the list returned by repeat is n *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
apply IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

Here's the corrected proof for the second lemma:

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma: Length of the list returned by repeat is n *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the Length function is not defined in the current environment. In Coq, the function to get the length of a list is called "length" (lowercase 'l'), not "Length" (uppercase 'L'). So, you should replace "Length" with "length" in the lemma statement. The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

The corrected lemma statement should be:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
apply IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` has a universal quantifier `Forall`, but the `apply` tactic expects an existential one. The `apply` tactic is used to apply a lemma to a goal, but in this case, the lemma `IHn'` is too general for the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the `specialize` tactic to instantiate the universal quantifier with the appropriate term. In this case, you want to instantiate it with the term `fun y => y = x`.

Here's the corrected proof for the second lemma:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - constructor.
  - constructor.
    specialize (

### Snippet
specialize (IHn' (fun y => y = x)

### Reflection

The error occurs in the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is with the application of the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the term `(fun y => y = x)`. The problem is that `IHn'` is a proof of the statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')`, but it is being applied to a term of type `nat -> Prop`.

To fix this error, you need to change the term `(fun y => y = x)` to a term of type `nat -> Prop` that is suitable for the `Forall` predicate. The statement `Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n')` means that for all `y`, `y` is equal to `x`. So, you should apply `IHn'` to a term that represents this property.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is not applicable to the current goal. The induction hypothesis is of the form `length (repeat x n') = n'`, but the goal is `length (repeat x (S n')) = S n'`. To fix this, you need to rewrite the goal using the constructor `S` before applying the induction hypothesis.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

length (repeat x n) = n

### given assumptions

X, x, n as follows.

X : Type
x : X
n : nat.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
rewrite IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is not applicable to the current goal. The induction hypothesis is of the form `length (repeat x n') = n'`, but the goal is `length (repeat x (S n')) = S n'`. To fix this, you need to rewrite the goal using the constructor `S` before applying the induction hypothesis.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.

Definition repeat {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat) : list X :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

Lemma Repeat_Length : forall {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat), length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros X x n

Lemma Repeat_Length : forall {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat), length (repeat x n) = n.

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is not applicable to the current goal. The induction hypothesis is of the form `length (repeat x n') = n'`, but the goal is `length (repeat x (S n')) = S n'`. To fix this, you need to rewrite the goal using the constructor `S` before applying the induction hypothesis.

[/INST]

The error message indicates that the reference "repeat" was not found in the current environment. This means that the function or the notation "repeat" is not defined or not in scope in the current Coq script. To fix this issue, you need to define the function "repeat" or import the module where it is defined, if it is a part of a standard library.</s>

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context


## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
rewrite IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is not applicable to the current goal. The induction hypothesis is of the form `length (repeat x n') = n'`, but the goal is `length (repeat x (S n')) = S n'`. To fix this, you need to rewrite the goal using the constructor `S` before applying the induction hypothesis.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.

Definition repeat {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat) : list X :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

Lemma Repeat_Length : forall {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat), length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros X x n

### Snippet
Lemma Repeat_Length : forall {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat), length (repeat

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the reference "repeat" was not found in the current environment. This means that the function or the notation "repeat" is not defined or not in scope in the current Coq script. To fix this issue, you need to define the function "repeat" or import the module where it is defined, if it is a part of a standard library.

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is not applicable to the current goal. The induction hypothesis is of the form `length (repeat x n') = n'`, but the goal is `length (repeat x (S n')) = S n'`. To fix this, you need to rewrite the goal using the constructor `S` before applying the induction hypothesis.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

forall (X : Type) (x : X) (n : nat),
length (repeat x n) = n

### given assumptions

(none).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
rewrite IHn'.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis `IHn'` is not applicable to the current goal. The induction hypothesis is of the form `length (repeat x n') = n'`, but the goal is `length (repeat x (S n')) = S n'`. To fix this, you need to rewrite the goal using the constructor `S` before applying the induction hypothesis.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.

Definition repeat {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat) : list X :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

Lemma Repeat_Length : forall {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat), length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros X x n

### Snippet
Lemma Repeat_Length : forall {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat), length (repeat

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the reference "repeat" was not found in the current environment. This means that the function or the notation "repeat" is not defined or not in scope in the current Coq script. To fix this issue, you need to define the function "repeat" or import the module where it is defined, if it is a part of a standard library.

### Snippet
Qed.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the proof is incomplete. The induction hypothesis is not used in the proof, and the goal is not solved. The tactic `auto` is not sufficient to complete the proof.

### Snippet
Lemma Repeat_Length : forall {X : Type} (x : X) (n : nat), length (repeat

### Reflection

The error message indicates that the reference "repeat" was not found in the current environment. This means that the function or the notation "repeat" is not defined or not in scope in the current Coq script. To fix this issue, you need to define the function "repeat" or import the module where it is defined, if it is a part of a standard library.

### Snippet
Qed.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the proof is incomplete. The induction hypothesis is not used in the proof, and the goal is not solved. The tactic `auto` is not sufficient to complete the proof.

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Context
### Need to show

In x (repeat x 0)

### given assumptions

x, y, H, H0 as follows.

x, y : nat
H, H0 : y = x.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

In y (repeat x n)

### given assumptions

x, n, y, eq as follows.

x, n, y : nat
eq : y = x.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=

The error is:

[/INST]

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Context
### Need to show

In x (repeat x n)

### given assumptions

x, n, y, eq, H, H0, H1, H2 as follows.

x, n, y : nat
eq, H, H0, H1, H2 : y = x.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation.

However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

In x (repeat x n)

### given assumptions

x, n, y, eq, H, H0, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13 as follows.

x, n, y : nat
eq, H, H0, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13 : y = x.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

In x (repeat x n)

### given assumptions

x, n, y, eq, H, H0, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15, H16, H17, H18 as follows.

eq, H, H0, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15, H16, H17, H18 : y = x.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

Here is the corrected proof:

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.

(* (1) Define the repeat function *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=

You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.

(* (1) Define the repeat function *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with

  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq

The error occurs because the term "y" is not present in the current goal. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal for each constructor of the type of the term being inversed. In this case, the type of "H" is "y = x", which has two constructors: "eq_refl" and "eq_sym". The "inversion" tactic introduces two subgoals, one for each constructor. However, after the inversion, the term "y" is no longer present in the current goal. Therefore, the "rewrite" tactic cannot find a subterm matching "y" and fails with the error.

To fix this error, you should rewrite the goal using the equality that was just introduced by the inversion. You can do this by replacing "now rewrite H0" with "now rewrite <- H0". The "<-" notation is used to rewrite the goal with the term

The error occurs because the term "H0" is not in the current context. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal with a new context, and "H0" is not available in this new context. To fix this error, you can use the "subst" tactic to substitute the equality in the context.

In this corrected proof, the "subst" tactic is used to substitute the equality in the context, making "H0" available for use. Then, "reflexivity" can be used to solve the goal.</s>

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with

  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.

(* (1) Define the repeat function *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n

### Snippet
now rewrite H0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "y" is not present in the current goal. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal for each constructor of the type of the term being inversed. In this case, the type of "H" is "y = x", which has two constructors: "eq_refl" and "eq_sym". The "inversion" tactic introduces two subgoals, one for each constructor. However, after the inversion, the term "y" is no longer present in the current goal. Therefore, the "rewrite" tactic cannot find a subterm matching "y" and fails with the error.

To fix this error, you should rewrite the goal using the equality that was just introduced by the inversion. You can do this by replacing "now rewrite H0" with "now rewrite <- H0". The "<-" notation is used to rewrite the goal with the term

### Snippet
now rewrite <- H0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "H0" is not in the current context. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal with a new context, and "H0" is not available in this new context. To fix this error, you can use the "subst" tactic to substitute the equality in the context.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n y eq.
  inversion eq.
  inversion H.
  subst.

In this corrected proof, the "subst" tactic is used to substitute the equality in the context, making "H0" available for use. Then, "reflexivity" can be used to solve the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.

(* (1) Define the repeat function *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n

### Snippet
now rewrite H0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "y" is not present in the current goal. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal for each constructor of the type of the term being inversed. In this case, the type of "H" is "y = x", which has two constructors: "eq_refl" and "eq_sym". The "inversion" tactic introduces two subgoals, one for each constructor. However, after the inversion, the term "y" is no longer present in the current goal. Therefore, the "rewrite" tactic cannot find a subterm matching "y" and fails with the error.

To fix this error, you should rewrite the goal using the equality that was just introduced by the inversion. You can do this by replacing "now rewrite H0" with "now rewrite <- H0". The "<-" notation is used to rewrite the goal with the term

### Snippet
now rewrite <- H0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "H0" is not in the current context. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal with a new context, and "H0" is not available in this new context. To fix this error, you can use the "subst" tactic to substitute the equality in the context.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n y eq.
  inversion eq.
  inversion H.
  subst.
  now reflexivity.
Qed.


In this corrected proof, the "subst" tactic is used to substitute the equality in the context, making "H0" available for use. Then, "reflexivity" can be used to solve the goal.

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not declared as reflexive in the Coq standard library. The `In` relation is used to check if an element belongs to a list. To fix this error, you need to declare the `In` relation as reflexive. You can do this by adding the following lines at the beginning of your code:

Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.

(* (1) Define the repeat function *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n

### Snippet
now rewrite H0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "y" is not present in the current goal. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal for each constructor of the type of the term being inversed. In this case, the type of "H" is "y = x", which has two constructors: "eq_refl" and "eq_sym". The "inversion" tactic introduces two subgoals, one for each constructor. However, after the inversion, the term "y" is no longer present in the current goal. Therefore, the "rewrite" tactic cannot find a subterm matching "y" and fails with the error.

To fix this error, you should rewrite the goal using the equality that was just introduced by the inversion. You can do this by replacing "now rewrite H0" with "now rewrite <- H0". The "<-" notation is used to rewrite the goal with the term

### Snippet
now rewrite <- H0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "H0" is not in the current context. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal with a new context, and "H0" is not available in this new context. To fix this error, you can use the "subst" tactic to substitute the equality in the context.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n y eq.
  inversion eq.
  inversion H.
  subst.
  now reflexivity.
Qed.


In this corrected proof, the "subst" tactic is used to substitute the equality in the context, making "H0" available for use. Then, "reflexivity" can be used to solve the goal.

### Snippet
now reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not declared as reflexive in the Coq standard library. The `In` relation is used to check if an element belongs to a list. To fix this error, you need to declare the `In` relation as reflexive. You can do this by adding the following lines at the beginning of your code:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.

Class In_reflexive {A : Type} (R : A -> A -> Prop) := {
  reflexivity : forall x, R x x;
}.

Instance In_reflexive_nat : In_reflexive nat (fun x y => x = y) := {
  reflexivity := fun x => eq_refl x;

Then, you need to modify

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Context


## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not strong enough to prove the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the length of (repeat x n') is n', but the goal is to prove that the length of (repeat x (S n')) is (S n'). The induction hypothesis does not directly imply the goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "induction" tactic to strengthen the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x n) = n.
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - reflexivity. (* base case: n = 0 *)
  - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.


In the second branch of the induction, we first use the "simpl" t

### Snippet
(* (3) Lemma that repeat returns a list where every element is x *)
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error is due to the fact that the previous proof (Lemma length_repeat) is not closed with "Qed." or "Defined." before starting the next proof (Lemma repeat_elements_equal). In Coq, each proof must be closed before starting a new one.

### Snippet
-

### Reflection

The error message "Wrong bullet -: Current bullet - is not finished" indicates that there is a problem with the bullet point in the Coq script. The bullet point is used to structure the script and separate different parts of the code. In this case, it seems that the bullet point is not properly closed, which causes the error.

To fix this error, you should close the bullet point with a period (.) or a double period (..) depending on the context. For example:

Coq
(* (1) Define the repeat function. *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n' => x :: repeat x n'
  end.

(* (2) Lemma that repeat returns a list of length n. *)
Lemma length_repeat : forall x n, length (repeat x

### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not reflexive by default in Coq. To use the `In` relation in a proof, you need to declare it as a reflexive relation. You can do this by requiring the `Coq.Classes.RelationClasses` library and proving the reflexivity axiom for the `In` relation. However, since `In` is already defined as a reflexive relation in the standard library, you can also use the `in` tactic instead of `reflexivity`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.

(* (1) Define the repeat function *)
Fixpoint repeat (x : nat) (n : nat) : list nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => nil
  | S n

### Snippet
now rewrite H0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "y" is not present in the current goal. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal for each constructor of the type of the term being inversed. In this case, the type of "H" is "y = x", which has two constructors: "eq_refl" and "eq_sym". The "inversion" tactic introduces two subgoals, one for each constructor. However, after the inversion, the term "y" is no longer present in the current goal. Therefore, the "rewrite" tactic cannot find a subterm matching "y" and fails with the error.

To fix this error, you should rewrite the goal using the equality that was just introduced by the inversion. You can do this by replacing "now rewrite H0" with "now rewrite <- H0". The "<-" notation is used to rewrite the goal with the term

### Snippet
now rewrite <- H0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the term "H0" is not in the current context. The "inversion" tactic introduces a new subgoal with a new context, and "H0" is not available in this new context. To fix this error, you can use the "subst" tactic to substitute the equality in the context.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements_equal : forall x n, forall y, y = x -> In y (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n y eq.
  inversion eq.
  inversion H.
  subst.
  now reflexivity.
Qed.


In this corrected proof, the "subst" tactic is used to substitute the equality in the context, making "H0" available for use. Then, "reflexivity" can be used to solve the goal.

### Snippet
now reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `In` relation is not declared as reflexive in the Coq standard library. The `In` relation is used to check if an element belongs to a list. To fix this error, you need to declare the `In` relation as reflexive. You can do this by adding the following lines at the beginning of your code:

Coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.
Require Import Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.

Class In_reflexive {A : Type} (R : A -> A -> Prop) := {
  reflexivity : forall x, R x x;
}.

Instance In_reflexive_nat : In_reflexive nat (fun x y => x = y) := {
  reflexivity := fun x => eq_refl x;
}.


Then, you need to modify

[/INST]

The error occurs because the `In_reflexive` class expects two arguments: a type `A` and a binary relation `R` on `A`. However, in the instance `In_reflexive_nat`, you are only providing one argument, `nat`, which is interpreted as the type `A`. Coq expects a binary relation of type `nat -> nat -> Prop`, but you have not provided one.

To fix this error, you need to provide a binary relation on `nat` as the second argument to `In_reflexive`. Since you want to define a reflexive relation, you can use the equality relation on `nat`, which is denoted as `(=)`. Here's the corrected code:

```Coq

 reflexivity : forall x, R x x;

The error occurs because the inversion tactic is trying to prove the goal "x = y" by inverting the equality "H : In y (repeat x (S n'))". However, the induction hypothesis "IHn'" is not applicable in this context because it requires a proof of "In y (repeat x n') -> y = x", but we only have a proof of "In y (repeat x (S n'))". The induction hypothesis cannot be applied to the current goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "specialize" tactic to apply the induction hypothesis to the current goal. Here's the corrected proof:

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not applicable in the current goal. The induction hypothesis is derived from the induction principle of the "n" variable, but the current goal does not have "n" in its context. The current goal is about an arbitrary element "y" in the list "repeat x n", and it is not related to the induction variable "n".

To fix this error, you can use the "inversion" tactic to break down the list membership into smaller cases, and then apply the induction hypothesis to the appropriate subgoal. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall {A : Type} (x : A) (n : nat),

The error occurs because the inversion tactic is trying to prove the goal "x = y" by inverting the equality "H : In y (repeat x (S n'))".

To fix this error, you can use the "inversion" tactic to break down the list membership into smaller cases, and then apply the induction hypothesis to the appropriate subgoal. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the inversion tactic is trying to prove the goal "x = y" by inverting the equality "H : In y (repeat x (S n'))". However, the induction hypothesis "IHn'" is not applicable in this context because it requires a proof of "In y (repeat x n') -> y = x", but we only have a proof of "In y (repeat x (S n'))". The induction hypothesis cannot be applied to the current goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "specialize" tactic to apply the induction hypothesis to the current goal. Here's the corrected proof:

### Reflection

The error occurs because the inversion tactic is trying to prove the goal "x = y" by inverting the equality "H : In y (repeat x (S n'))". However, the induction hypothesis "IHn'" is not applicable in this context because it requires a proof of "In y (repeat x n') -> y = x", but we only have a proof of "In y (repeat x (S n'))". The induction hypothesis cannot be applied to the current goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "specialize" tactic to apply the induction hypothesis to the current goal. Here's the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall {A : Type} (x : A) (n : nat),
  forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.

The error message is pointing to the incorrect use of the "+" bullet in the last line of the proof of the Lemma "repeat_elements". The "+" bullet is used to introduce a new subgoal, but it is not needed in this context. The "intros" tactic has already introduced the necessary subgoals.

To fix this error, simply remove the "+" bullet:

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not applicable in the current goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "inversion" tactic to break down the list membership into smaller cases, and then apply the induction hypothesis to the appropriate subgoal. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

### Reflection

The error occurs because the inversion tactic is trying to prove the goal "x = y" by inverting the equality "H : In y (repeat x (S n'))". However, the induction hypothesis "IHn'" is not applicable in this context because it requires a proof of "In y (repeat x n') -> y = x", but we only have a proof of "In y (repeat x (S n'))". The induction hypothesis cannot be applied to the current goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "specialize" tactic to apply the induction hypothesis to the current goal. Here's the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall {A : Type} (x : A) (n : nat),
  forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.

To fix this error, simply remove the "+" bullet:

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not applicable in the current goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "inversion" tactic to break down the list membership into smaller cases, and then apply the induction hypothesis to the appropriate subgoal. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.



You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Context
### Need to show

y = x

### given assumptions

A : Type
x, y : A
H : In y (repeat x 0).

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
inversion H as [|H'].
    + reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the inversion tactic is trying to prove the goal "x = y" by inverting the equality "H : In y (repeat x (S n'))". However, the induction hypothesis "IHn'" is not applicable in this context because it requires a proof of "In y (repeat x n') -> y = x", but we only have a proof of "In y (repeat x (S n'))". The induction hypothesis cannot be applied to the current goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "specialize" tactic to apply the induction hypothesis to the current goal. Here's the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall {A : Type} (x : A) (n : nat),
  forall y, In y (repeat x n) -> y = x.
Proof.

### Reflection

The error message is pointing to the incorrect use of the "+" bullet in the last line of the proof of the Lemma "repeat_elements". The "+" bullet is used to introduce a new subgoal, but it is not needed in this context. The "intros" tactic has already introduced the necessary subgoals.

To fix this error, simply remove the "+" bullet:

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not applicable in the current goal. The induction hypothesis is derived from the induction principle of the "n" variable, but the current goal does not have "n" in its context. The current goal is about an arbitrary element "y" in the list "repeat x n", and it is not related to the induction variable "n".

To fix this error, you can use the "inversion" tactic to break down the list membership into smaller cases, and then apply the induction hypothesis to the appropriate subgoal. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall {A : Type} (x : A) (n : nat),

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not applicable in the current goal. The induction hypothesis is derived from the induction principle of the "n" variable, but the current goal does not have "n" in its context. The current goal is about an arbitrary element "y" in the list "repeat x n", and it is not related to the induction variable "n".

To fix this error, you can use the "inversion" tactic to break down the list membership into smaller cases, and then apply the induction hypothesis to the appropriate subgoal. Here is a corrected version of the proof:

The error occurs because the inversion tactic is trying to prove the goal "x = y" by inverting the equality "H : In y (repeat x (S n'))". However, the induction hypothesis "IHn'" is not applicable in this context because it requires a proof of "In y (repeat x n') -> y = x", but we only have a proof of "In y (repeat x (S n'))". The induction hypothesis cannot be applied to the current goal.

To fix this error, you can use the "specialize" tactic to apply the induction hypothesis to the current goal. Here's the corrected proof:

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n` *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, List.length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs in the last line of the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is that the `reflexivity` tactic is being used, but it is not applicable in this context because the relation `Forall` is not reflexive.

To fix this error, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y` and then use the `discriminate` tactic to conclude the proof. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y. reflexivity.
  - intros y. apply IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `intros` tactic is used incorrectly. The `intros` tactic is used to introduce variables in the context, but in this case, it is used after the `induction` tactic, which already introduces the variable `y`. The correct way to proceed is to first apply the `induction` tactic and then use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).

The error occurs because the induction tactic is used incorrectly. The induction tactic is used to prove properties of recursive functions by structural induction on their input. In this case, the function `repeat` is defined by induction on the second argument `n`. However, the induction tactic is applied to `n`, which is not the correct argument for the induction.

To fix this error, you should first apply the induction tactic to `n`, and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the list resulting from the recursive call to `repeat`. Here is the corrected proof:

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction tactic is used incorrectly. The induction tactic is used to prove properties of recursive functions by structural induction on their input. In this case, the function `repeat` is defined by induction on the second argument `n`. However, the induction tactic is applied to `n`, which is not the correct argument for the induction.

To fix this error, you should first apply the induction tactic to `n`, and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the list resulting from the recursive call to `repeat`. Here is the corrected proof:

(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, List.length (repeat x n) = n.

reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs in the last line of the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is that the `reflexivity` tactic is being used, but it is not applicable in this context because the relation `Forall` is not reflexive.

To fix this error, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y` and then use the `discriminate` tactic to conclude the proof. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `intros` tactic is used incorrectly. The `intros` tactic is used to introduce variables in the context, but in this case, it is used after the `induction` tactic, which already introduces the variable `y`. The correct way to proceed is to first apply the `induction` tactic and then use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.

  - simpl. intros y. reflexivity.
  - simpl. intros y. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction tactic is used incorrectly. The induction tactic is used to prove properties of recursive functions by structural induction on their input. In this case, the function `repeat` is defined by induction on the second argument `n`. However, the induction tactic is applied to `n`, which is not the correct argument for the induction.

To fix this error, you should first apply the induction tactic to `n`, and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the list resulting from the recursive call to `repeat`. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

length (repeat x 0) = 0

### given assumptions

x as follows.

x : nat.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n` *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, List.length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs in the last line of the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is that the `reflexivity` tactic is being used, but it is not applicable in this context because the relation `Forall` is not reflexive.

To fix this error, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y` and then use the `discriminate` tactic to conclude the proof. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y. reflexivity.
  - intros y. apply IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `intros` tactic is used incorrectly. The `intros` tactic is used to introduce variables in the context, but in this case, it is used after the `induction` tactic, which already introduces the variable `y`. The correct way to proceed is to first apply the `induction` tactic and then use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - simpl. intros y. reflexivity.
  - simpl. intros y. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction tactic is used incorrectly. The induction tactic is used to prove properties of recursive functions by structural induction on their input. In this case, the function `repeat` is defined by induction on the second argument `n`. However, the induction tactic is applied to `n`, which is not the correct argument for the induction.

To fix this error, you should first apply the induction tactic to `n`, and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the list resulting from the recursive call to `repeat`. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y. reflexivity.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.



You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

Forall (fun y : nat => y = x) []

### given assumptions

x as follows.

x : nat.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n` *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, List.length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs in the last line of the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is that the `reflexivity` tactic is being used, but it is not applicable in this context because the relation `Forall` is not reflexive.

To fix this error, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y` and then use the `discriminate` tactic to conclude the proof. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y. reflexivity.
  - intros y. apply IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `intros` tactic is used incorrectly. The `intros` tactic is used to introduce variables in the context, but in this case, it is used after the `induction` tactic, which already introduces the variable `y`. The correct way to proceed is to first apply the `induction` tactic and then use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - simpl. intros y. reflexivity.
  - simpl. intros y. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction tactic is used incorrectly. The induction tactic is used to prove properties of recursive functions by structural induction on their input. In this case, the function `repeat` is defined by induction on the second argument `n`. However, the induction tactic is applied to `n`, which is not the correct argument for the induction.

To fix this error, you should first apply the induction tactic to `n`, and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the list resulting from the recursive call to `repeat`. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).

### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n` *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, List.length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs in the last line of the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is that the `reflexivity` tactic is being used, but it is not applicable in this context because the relation `Forall` is not reflexive.

To fix this error, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y` and then use the `discriminate` tactic to conclude the proof. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y. reflexivity.
  - intros y. apply IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `intros` tactic is used incorrectly. The `intros` tactic is used to introduce variables in the context, but in this case, it is used after the `induction` tactic, which already introduces the variable `y`. The correct way to proceed is to first apply the `induction` tactic and then use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - simpl. intros y. reflexivity.
  - simpl. intros y. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction tactic is used incorrectly. The induction tactic is used to prove properties of recursive functions by structural induction on their input. In this case, the function `repeat` is defined by induction on the second argument `n`. However, the induction tactic is applied to `n`, which is not the correct argument for the induction.

To fix this error, you should first apply the induction tactic to `n`, and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the list resulting from the recursive call to `repeat`. Here is the corrected proof:

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n` *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, List.length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs in the last line of the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is that the `reflexivity` tactic is being used, but it is not applicable in this context because the relation `Forall` is not reflexive.

To fix this error, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y` and then use the `discriminate` tactic to conclude the proof. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y. reflexivity.
  - intros y. apply IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `intros` tactic is used incorrectly. The `intros` tactic is used to introduce variables in the context, but in this case, it is used after the `induction` tactic, which already introduces the variable `y`. The correct way to proceed is to first apply the `induction` tactic and then use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - simpl. intros y. reflexivity.
  - simpl. intros y. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction tactic is used incorrectly. The induction tactic is used to prove properties of recursive functions by structural induction on their input. In this case, the function `repeat` is defined by induction on the second argument `n`. However, the induction tactic is applied to `n`, which is not the correct argument for the induction.

To fix this error, you should first apply the induction tactic to `n`, and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the list resulting from the recursive call to `repeat`. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).

(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

Forall (fun y : nat => y = x) []

### given assumptions

x as follows.

x : nat.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
(* (2) Lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n` *)
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, Length

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `Length` function is not defined in the Coq standard library. The correct function to use is `List.length`. So, you should replace `Length` with `List.length` in the lemma statement.

Here is the corrected lemma statement:

Coq
Lemma repeat_length : forall x n, List.length (repeat x n) = n.


### Snippet
reflexivity.

### Reflection

The error occurs in the last line of the proof of the lemma `repeat_elements`. The issue is that the `reflexivity` tactic is being used, but it is not applicable in this context because the relation `Forall` is not reflexive.

To fix this error, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y` and then use the `discriminate` tactic to conclude the proof. Here's the corrected proof script:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y. reflexivity.
  - intros y. apply IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the `intros` tactic is used incorrectly. The `intros` tactic is used to introduce variables in the context, but in this case, it is used after the `induction` tactic, which already introduces the variable `y`. The correct way to proceed is to first apply the `induction` tactic and then use the `intros` tactic to introduce the variable `y`.

Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - simpl. intros y. reflexivity.
  - simpl. intros y. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.
Qed.


### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction tactic is used incorrectly. The induction tactic is used to prove properties of recursive functions by structural induction on their input. In this case, the function `repeat` is defined by induction on the second argument `n`. However, the induction tactic is applied to `n`, which is not the correct argument for the induction.

To fix this error, you should first apply the induction tactic to `n`, and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the list resulting from the recursive call to `repeat`. Here is the corrected proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y. reflexivity.

The error occurs because the goal is not an inductive type with one constructor. The `Forall` function is not an inductive type, so it cannot be handled by the `induction` tactic.

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHl') is not applicable in the current context. The induction hypothesis is generated based on the structure of the term being inducted on, which in this case is a list. However, the induction hypothesis is generated for the term "repeat x n", not "repeat x n'". 

To fix this error, you need to adjust the induction hypothesis to match the correct term. You can do this by introducing a new variable for the length of the list and using it in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Instead, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the universal quantifier and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the lemma `repeat_length` to prove the goal.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  apply (repeat_length x n).
  intros y.
  rewrite <- eq_iff_iff.
  reflexivity.
Qed.


In this corrected version, we first use `intros` to introduce the universal quantifier. Then, we apply the

### Snippet
apply (repeat_length x n)

### Reflection

The error occurs because the lemma "repeat_length" has nothing to do with the goal "Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n)". The former lemma states that the length of the list produced by "repeat" is equal to the second argument, while the goal is to prove that all elements in the list produced by "repeat" are equal to the first argument. These two statements are not logically related, hence the unification error.

To prove the goal, you should instead use induction on the list produced by "repeat" and prove that each element is equal to the first argument.

### Snippet
induction (repeat x n) as [|y l' IHl'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHl') is not applicable in the current context. The induction hypothesis is generated based on the structure of the term being inducted on, which in this case is a list. However, the induction hypothesis is generated for the term "repeat x n", not "repeat x n'". 

To fix this error, you need to adjust the induction hypothesis to match the correct term. You can do this by introducing a new variable for the length of the list and using it in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHl') is not applicable in the current context. The induction hypothesis is generated based on the structure of the term being inducted on, which in this case is a list. However, the induction hypothesis is generated for the term "repeat x n", not "repeat x n'". 

To fix this error, you need to adjust the induction hypothesis to match the correct term. You can do this by introducing a new variable for the length of the list and using it in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq

Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.
  - intros y.
    induction (repeat x n') as [

### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not used correctly in the proof of the second lemma (repeat_elements). The induction hypothesis is a statement about the property of the list `repeat x n'`, but it is not applied to the goal involving `y`.

To fix this error, you should use the induction hypothesis to rewrite the goal involving `y`. Here is a possible solution:

### Reflection

The error occurs because the goal is not an inductive type with one constructor. The `Forall` function is not an inductive type, so it cannot be handled by the `induction` tactic. Instead, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the universal quantifier and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the lemma `repeat_length` to prove the goal.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).

### Snippet

### Reflection

The error occurs because the lemma "repeat_length" has nothing to do with the goal "Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n)".

These two statements are not logically related, hence the unification error.

To prove the goal, you should instead use induction on the list produced by "repeat" and prove that each element is equal to the first argument.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the goal is not an inductive type with one constructor. The `Forall` function is not an inductive type, so it cannot be handled by the `induction` tactic. Instead, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the universal quantifier and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the lemma `repeat_length` to prove the goal.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  apply (repeat_length x n).
  intros y.

In this corrected version, we first use `intros` to introduce the universal quantifier. Then, we apply the

### Snippet
apply (repeat_length x n)

### Reflection

The error occurs because the lemma "repeat_length" has nothing to do with the goal "Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n)". The former lemma states that the length of the list produced by "repeat" is equal to the second argument, while the goal is to prove that all elements in the list produced by "repeat" are equal to the first argument. These two statements are not logically related, hence the unification error.

To prove the goal, you should instead use induction on the list produced by "repeat" and prove that each element is equal to the first argument.

### Snippet
induction (repeat x n) as [|y l' IHl'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHl') is not applicable in the current context. The induction hypothesis is generated based on the structure of the term being inducted on, which in this case is a list. However, the induction hypothesis is generated for the term "repeat x n", not "repeat x n'". 

To fix this error, you need to adjust the induction hypothesis to match the correct term. You can do this by introducing a new variable for the length of the list and using it in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.
  - intros y.
    induction (repeat x n') as [

### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not used correctly in the proof of the second lemma (repeat_elements). The induction hypothesis is a statement about the property of the list `repeat x n'`, but it is not applied to the goal involving `y`.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

S (length (repeat x n')) = S n'

### given assumptions

x, n', IHn' as follows.

x, n' : nat
IHn' : length (repeat x n') = n'.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - exists 0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the goal is not an inductive type with one constructor. The `Forall` function is not an inductive type, so it cannot be handled by the `induction` tactic. Instead, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the universal quantifier and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the lemma `repeat_length` to prove the goal.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  apply (repeat_length x n).
  intros y.
  rewrite <- eq_iff_iff.
  reflexivity.
Qed.


In this corrected version, we first use `intros` to introduce the universal quantifier. Then, we apply the

### Snippet
apply (repeat_length x n)

### Reflection

The error occurs because the lemma "repeat_length" has nothing to do with the goal "Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n)". The former lemma states that the length of the list produced by "repeat" is equal to the second argument, while the goal is to prove that all elements in the list produced by "repeat" are equal to the first argument. These two statements are not logically related, hence the unification error.

To prove the goal, you should instead use induction on the list produced by "repeat" and prove that each element is equal to the first argument.

### Snippet
induction (repeat x n) as [|y l' IHl'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHl') is not applicable in the current context. The induction hypothesis is generated based on the structure of the term being inducted on, which in this case is a list. However, the induction hypothesis is generated for the term "repeat x n", not "repeat x n'". 

To fix this error, you need to adjust the induction hypothesis to match the correct term. You can do this by introducing a new variable for the length of the list and using it in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.
  - intros y.
    induction (repeat x n') as [

### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not used correctly in the proof of the second lemma (repeat_elements). The induction hypothesis is a statement about the property of the list `repeat x n'`, but it is not applied to the goal involving `y`.

To fix this error, you should use the induction hypothesis to rewrite the goal involving `y`. Here is a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.

(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - exists 0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the goal is not an inductive type with one constructor. The `Forall` function is not an inductive type, so it cannot be handled by the `induction` tactic. Instead, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the universal quantifier and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the lemma `repeat_length` to prove the goal.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  apply (repeat_length x n).
  intros y.
  rewrite <- eq_iff_iff.
  reflexivity.
Qed.


In this corrected version, we first use `intros` to introduce the universal quantifier. Then, we apply the

### Snippet
apply (repeat_length x n)

### Reflection

The error occurs because the lemma "repeat_length" has nothing to do with the goal "Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n)". The former lemma states that the length of the list produced by "repeat" is equal to the second argument, while the goal is to prove that all elements in the list produced by "repeat" are equal to the first argument. These two statements are not logically related, hence the unification error.

To prove the goal, you should instead use induction on the list produced by "repeat" and prove that each element is equal to the first argument.

### Snippet
induction (repeat x n) as [|y l' IHl'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHl') is not applicable in the current context. The induction hypothesis is generated based on the structure of the term being inducted on, which in this case is a list. However, the induction hypothesis is generated for the term "repeat x n", not "repeat x n'". 

To fix this error, you need to adjust the induction hypothesis to match the correct term. You can do this by introducing a new variable for the length of the list and using it in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.
  - intros y.
    induction (repeat x n') as [

### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not used correctly in the proof of the second lemma (repeat_elements). The induction hypothesis is a statement about the property of the list `repeat x n'`, but it is not applied to the goal involving `y`.

To fix this error, you should use the induction hypothesis to rewrite the goal involving `y`. Here is a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.
  - intros y.
    rewrite <- IHn'.
    reflexivity.
Qed.


In the second branch of the induction, we first `intros y`. Then, we use the induction hypothesis

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.
  - intros y.
    induction (repeat x n') as [

### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not used correctly in the proof of the second lemma (repeat_elements). The induction hypothesis is a statement about the property of the list `repeat x n'`, but it is not applied to the goal involving `y`.

To fix this error, you should use the induction hypothesis to rewrite the goal involving `y`. Here is a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).

  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.

In the second branch of the induction, we first `intros y`. Then, we use the induction hypothesis

(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the goal is not an inductive type with one constructor. The `Forall` function is not an inductive type, so it cannot be handled by the `induction` tactic. Instead, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the universal quantifier and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the lemma `repeat_length` to prove the goal.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).

### Snippet
apply (repeat_length x n)

### Reflection

The error occurs because the lemma "repeat_length" has nothing to do with the goal "Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n)". The former lemma states that the length of the list produced by "repeat" is equal to the second argument, while the goal is to prove that all elements in the list produced by "repeat" are equal to the first argument. These two statements are not logically related, hence the unification error.

To prove the goal, you should instead use induction on the list produced by "repeat" and prove that each element is equal to the first argument.

### Snippet

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHl') is not applicable in the current context.

The induction hypothesis is generated based on the structure of the term being inducted on, which in this case is a list. However, the induction hypothesis is generated for the term "repeat x n", not "repeat x n'". 

To fix this error, you need to adjust the induction hypothesis to match the correct term. You can do this by introducing a new variable for the length of the list and using it in the induction hypothesis. Here's a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.
  - intros y.
    induction (repeat x n') as [

### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y;

### Reflection

The error occurs because the induction hypothesis (IHn') is not used correctly in the proof of the second lemma (repeat_elements). The induction hypothesis is a statement about the property of the list `repeat x n'`, but it is not applied to the goal involving `y`.

To fix this error, you should use the induction hypothesis to rewrite the goal involving `y`. Here is a possible solution:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - intros y; inversion H.
  - intros y.
    rewrite <- IHn'.
    reflexivity.
Qed.


In the second branch of the induction, we first `intros y`. Then, we use the induction hypothesis

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.



You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Reflections from previous attempts
### Snippet
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
  - exists 0.

### Reflection

The error occurs because the goal is not an inductive type with one constructor. The `Forall` function is not an inductive type, so it cannot be handled by the `induction` tactic. Instead, you should use the `intros` tactic to introduce the universal quantifier and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the lemma `repeat_length` to prove the goal.

Here is a corrected version of the proof:

Coq
Lemma repeat_elements : forall x n, Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n).
Proof.
  intros x n.
  apply (repeat_length x n).
  intros y.
  rewrite <- eq_iff_iff.
  reflexivity.
Qed.


In this corrected version, we first use `intros` to introduce the universal quantifier. Then, we apply the

### Snippet
apply (repeat_length x n)

### Reflection

The error occurs because the lemma "repeat_length" has nothing to do with the goal "Forall (fun y => y = x) (repeat x n)". The former lemma states that the length of the list produced by "repeat" is equal to the second argument, while the goal is to prove that all elements in the list produced by "repeat" are equal to the first argument. These two statements are not logically related, hence the unification error.

To prove the goal, you should instead use induction on the list produced by "repeat" and prove that each element is equal to the first argument.
