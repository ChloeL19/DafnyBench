<s> ### Spec: In Coq, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.
### Hint: Don't forget to import the Arith module.
### Hint: use `Nat.lt_0_1` in the base case of the proof.
### Hint: use `Nat.lt_lt_add_r` in the inductive case of the proof.

```coq
Require Import Coq.Arith.Arith.

Fixpoint factorial (n : nat) : nat :=
 match n with
 | 0 => 1
 | S n' => n * factorial n'
 end.

Theorem factorial_pos : forall n, 0 < factorial n.
Proof.
 intros n.
 induction n as [|n' IHn'].
 - now rewrite Nat.lt_0_1.
 - now rewrite Nat.lt_lt_add_r, IHn', Nat.mul_lt_mul_of_lt_of_le.
Qed.
```

In this Coq script, we first define a factorial function on natural numbers. Then we prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.

The proof is by induction on `n`. In the base case, we have `n = 0`, and we use `Nat.lt_0_1` to show `0 < factorial 0`.

In the inductive case, we have `n = S n'`, and we use `Nat.lt_lt_add_r` to show `0 < factorial (S n')`. We also use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show `0 < factorial n'`. Finally, we use `Nat.mul_lt_mul_of_lt_of_le` to complete the proof.</s>
