This Coq script defines a factorial function and proves that the factorial of any natural number is strictly positive.

The `factorial` function is defined by pattern matching on its argument `n`. If `n` is 0, then the function returns 1. Otherwise, `n` is a successor (`S`) of some smaller natural number `n'`, and the function returns `n * factorial n'`.

The `factorial_pos` theorem is proved by induction on `n`. The base case of the induction is `n = 0`, for which we rewrite `Nat.lt_0_1` to prove `0 < factorial 0`. The inductive case of the induction is `n = S n'`, for which we rewrite `Nat.lt_lt_add_r` and `IHn'` (the induction hypothesis) to prove `0 < factorial (S n')`.</s>

The `factorial` function is defined by pattern matching on the input `n`. If `n` is `0`, then the function returns `1`. Otherwise, it multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n'` (the predecessor of `n`).

The proof `factorial_pos` is by induction on `n`. The base case is `0 < factorial 0`, which is proven using `Nat.lt_0_1`.

The inductive case is `0 < factorial (S n')`, where `n'` is the predecessor of `n`. This is proven using `Nat.lt_lt_add_r`. The first argument to `Nat.lt_lt_add_r` is `(n * factorial n')`, which represents the successor of `factorial n'`. The second argument is `n'`, and the third argument is `n'0`, which is a variable that represents `0 < factorial n'`. Since `n'` and `n'0` are both less than `n`, their product `n * factorial n'` is also less than `n`.

The proof concludes with `Qed`, which stands for "Quod Erat Demonstrandum", Latin for "which was to be demonstrated". This marks the end of the proof.</s>

The proof `factorial_pos` is by induction on `n`. The base case is `0 < factorial 0`, which is proven using `Nat.lt_0_1`.

The inductive case is `0 < factorial (S n')`, where `n'` is the predecessor of `n`. This is proven using `Nat.lt_lt_add_r`.

Since `n'` and `n'0` are both less than `n`, their product `n * factorial n'` is also less than `n`.

The proof concludes with `Qed`, which stands for "Quod Erat Demonstrandum", Latin for "which was to be demonstrated". This marks the end of the proof.

The proof `factorial_pos` is then defined to show that the factorial of any natural number n is strictly positive. We use induction on n.

In the base case, where n is 0, we simplify the expression and apply the lemma `Nat.lt_0_1` to show that 0 < 1.

In the inductive case, where n is any natural number greater than 0, we simplify the expression and apply the lemma `Nat.lt_lt_add_r`. This lemma states that if a < b and c < d, then a + c < b + d. We apply the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that the factorial of n' is positive, and then the result follows by transitivity of the less-than relation.</s>

The proof `factorial_pos` is then defined to show that the factorial of any natural number n is strictly positive. We use induction on n.

In the base case, where n is 0, we simplify the expression and apply the lemma `Nat.lt_0_1` to show that 0 < 1.

In the inductive case, where n is any natural number greater than 0, we simplify the expression and apply the lemma `Nat.lt_lt_add_r`. This lemma states that if a < b and c < d, then a + c < b + d. We apply the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that the factorial of n' is positive, and then the result follows by transitivity of the less-than relation.
