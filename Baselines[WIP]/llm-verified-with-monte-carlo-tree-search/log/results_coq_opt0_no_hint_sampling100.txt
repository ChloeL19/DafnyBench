In this Coq script, we first define an ADT `ArithExpr` to represent arithmetic expressions. We then define an evaluator function `eval` that takes an arithmetic expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to numbers) and returns the result of evaluating the expression in the given environment. 

Next, we define an optimizer function `optimize` that takes an arithmetic expression and removes all additions by 0. 

Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the evaluation function. This is done by induction on the structure of the arithmetic expressions. The base cases for constants and variables are straightforward to prove, as optimizing them doesn't change their semantics. For the addition case, we need to prove that optimizing the sum of two expressions is the same as evaluating the sum of the optimized expressions. This is done using the induction hypothesis on the two subexpressions.</s>

In this Coq script, we define an inductive type AExpr to represent arithmetic expressions. It has three constructors for constants, variables, and additions. The function eval takes an arithmetic expression and an environment and evaluates the expression in the given environment. The function opt takes an arithmetic expression and optimizes it by removing all additions by 0. The theorem opt_preserves_semantics proves that the optimization does not change the semantics of the expressions, i.e., the result of evaluating the optimized expression is the same as that of the original one.</s>

In this Coq script, we first define the `ArithExpr` data type, which represents arithmetic expressions. We then define the `eval` function, which takes an arithmetic expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to their values), and computes the result of evaluating the expression in the given environment.

Next, we define the `optimize` function, which takes an arithmetic expression and returns an "optimized" version of the expression. In this case, the optimization consists of removing all additions by 0, since adding 0 does not change the result.

Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions, by proving that for any arithmetic expression and environment, the evaluation of the optimized expression is equal to the evaluation of the original expression. We do this by induction on the structure of the expressions.</s>

In this script, we first define an ADT for arithmetic expressions using Coq's inductive types. The `Expr` type represents constants (represented by natural numbers), variables (represented by strings), and additions of expressions.

We then define the evaluator function `eval` that takes an expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to their values) and returns the value of the expression. The evaluator is defined by pattern matching on the structure of the expression.

The optimizer function `optimize` is defined by recursively simplifying the expression: it removes additions by 0.

In this script, we first define an ADT for arithmetic expressions using Coq's inductive types. The `Expr` type represents constants (represented by natural numbers), variables (represented by strings), and additions of expressions.

We then define the evaluator function `eval` that takes an expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to their values) and returns the value of the expression. The evaluator is defined by pattern matching on the structure of the expression.

The optimizer function `optimize` is defined by recursively simplifying the expression: it removes additions by 0.

Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions by defining a theorem `optimize_preserves_semantics` and proving it by induction on the structure of the expressions. The proof is a bit complex due to the need to handle all the cases for the different constructors of the `Expr` type. However, the main idea is that after simplifying the expression, the optimized expression should have the same value as the original one for any environment.

Note: This Coq script is not complete and has some issues. The main issue is the use of `Admitted` instead of `Qed` which means that the proof is not fully checked by Coq. The `Admitted` command is used when the proof is incomplete or when the theorem is incorrect. In this case, the proof is not complete and needs more details to be fully correct.

The correct proof requires to handle more cases for the induction on `e` and to consider the case where `optimizer e1` or `optimizer e2` is `Const 0`.

Finally, we prove that the optimization does not change the semantics of the expressions, i.e., `eval (optimize e) env = eval e env` for all expressions `e` and environments `env`, by structural induction on `e`.

This script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator function that takes an expression and an environment to interpret variable names, and an optimizer that removes additions by 0. The `opt_preserves_semantics` theorem shows that the optimizer does not change the result of the evaluation function.

The script uses the Inductive definition to define the Exp type, which represents arithmetic expressions. It then defines the environment and the evaluation function. The evaluation function recursively evaluates the expressions by pattern matching on the expression and the environment.

The optimizer function is defined by recursively optimizing the sub-expressions of an addition expression. If the left sub-expression is a constant 0, the optimizer just returns the right sub-expression.

The theorem `opt_preserves_semantics` is then proved by structural induction on the expression `e`. It states that if `eval e env = eval e' env`, then `eval (opt e) env = eval e' env`, meaning that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the evaluation function.</s>

This script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator function that takes an expression and an environment to interpret variable names, and an optimizer that removes additions by 0. The `opt_preserves_semantics` theorem shows that the optimizer does not change the result of the evaluation function.

The script uses the Inductive definition to define the Exp type, which represents arithmetic expressions. It then defines the environment and the evaluation function. The evaluation function recursively evaluates the expressions by pattern matching on the expression and the environment.

The optimizer function is defined by recursively optimizing the sub-expressions of an addition expression. If the left sub-expression is a constant 0, the optimizer just returns the right sub-expression.

The theorem `opt_preserves_semantics` is then proved by structural induction on the expression `e`. It states that if `eval e env = eval e' env`, then `eval (opt e) env = eval e' env`, meaning that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the evaluation function.

The code above defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluation function, and an optimizer. The optimizer removes additions by 0 from the expression. The proof `opt_preserves_semantics` shows that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions, meaning that the result of the evaluation of the optimized expression is the same as the original expression.

This script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions in Coq. It then defines an evaluator function `eval` and an optimizer function `optimize`. The theorem `optimize_preserves_semantics` states that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions, i.e., it does not change their evaluation result. This is proved by structural induction on the expression `e1`.

Please note that this is a simple and naive optimizer that only removes additions by 0. There are many other optimizations that could be performed, but this example demonstrates the basic structure of an optimizer for this simple ADT.</s>

In this script, we define an inductive type `AExp` to represent arithmetic expressions. We then define an `eval` function to evaluate expressions, an `optimize` function to optimize expressions, and finally a theorem `optimize_preserves_semantics` that proves the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions.

The `eval` function recursively evaluates a given expression using the provided environment. If the expression is a constant, it simply returns the constant value. If the expression is a variable, it looks up the variable's value in the environment. If the expression is an addition, it recursively evaluates its operands and adds their values.

The `optimize` function removes additions by 0 in a recursive manner. If an addition's left operand is 0, it optimizes the right operand and returns it. If the right operand is 0, it optimizes the left operand and returns it. If neither operand is 0, it optimizes both operands and constructs a new addition. If the expression is neither a constant, variable, nor addition, it returns the expression unchanged.

The `optimize_preserves_semantics` theorem is proved by structural induction on the expression. It first shows that the optimizer preserves semantics for constants and variables. Then it shows that if the right operand of an addition is 0, the optimizer preserves semantics. Finally, it shows that if neither operand of an addition is 0, the optimizer preserves semantics.</s>

This Coq script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator, an optimizer, and a proof that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions. The optimizer removes additions by 0. The proof is by structural induction on the expression. The base cases for Const, Var, and the two Add constructors handle the recursive calls on the sub-expressions. The IH (IHe1, IHe2) represent the induction hypotheses.

The proof is complete once we've covered all the constructors for ArithExpr. The last line outside the proof script is a Qed, which ends the proof.

The script could be further extended to include more complex expressions (subtraction, multiplication, etc.), more advanced optimizations, and additional properties to prove about the optimizer and evaluator.</s>

The proof of the theorem is left incomplete as we are unable to progress further due to the complexity of the proof. This is a challenging exercise and requires a deep understanding of Coq and its tactics. It's also important to note that optimizing away additions by 0 is just one of many possible optimizations. Depending on your actual needs, you might want to consider other optimizations as well.

Here's a sketch of how the proof might go:

1. By induction on `e1`.
2. For the base cases (`Const` and `Var`), you just need to show that `optimize` doesn't change anything, which should be straightforward given the definitions of `optimize` and the fact that `eval` is unchanged for these cases.
3. For the `Add` case, you need to consider the different possibilities for the optimized sub-expressions `optimize e1` and `optimize e2`:
  - If `optimize e1` is `Const 0`, then `optimize e1` must have been `e1` which was `Const 0` to begin with, so `eval (optimize e1) env = eval e2 env` by the induction hypothesis.
  - Similarly, if `optimize e2` is `Const 0`, then it must have been `e2` which was `Const 0` to begin with, so `eval e1 env = eval (optimize e2) env` by the induction hypothesis.
  - If neither `optimize e1` nor `optimize e2` is `Const 0`, then `eval (Add (optimize e1) (optimize e2)) env = eval (Add e1 e2) env` by the induction hypothesis, and you can proceed by computation.

This is a high-level outline of the proof and you'll need to fill in the details, including the actual Coq expressions and tactics to manipulate them. Keep in mind that this is a relatively complex proof and might require some time and effort to complete.</s>

This Coq script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator, an optimizer, and a theorem that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions.

The `Expr` type represents arithmetic expressions:
- `Const n` represents a constant number n,
- `Var x` represents a variable x,
- `Add e1 e2` represents the addition of two expressions e1 and e2.

The `eval` function takes an expression and an environment (a function from variable names to their values), and computes the value of the expression in the given environment.

The `optimizer` function takes an expression and removes all additions by 0 from it.

The `optimizer_preserves_semantics` theorem states that the optimizer does not change the value of an expression. It is proved by induction on the structure of expressions. The base cases for constants and variables are trivial. For the addition case, the theorem is proved by recursively invoking the theorem for the sub-expressions and simplifying the addition with 0. For the optimizer case, the theorem is proved by recursively invoking the theorem for the sub-expression and simplifying the optimizer application.</s>

In this Coq script, we define an inductive type `AExp` for arithmetic expressions, consisting of constants, variables, and additions. We then define an evaluator `eval` that takes an expression and an environment (represented as a function from strings to numbers) and returns the result of evaluating the expression in the given environment.

Next, we define an optimizer `optimize` that takes an expression and returns an equivalent expression with all additions by 0 removed. The proof `optimize_preserves_semantics` shows that the optimization does not change the result of the evaluation, i.e., `eval (optimize e) env = eval e env` for all expressions `e` and environments `env`.

The proof is by structural induction on the expression `e`. The base cases for constants and variables are trivial, as optimizing them has no effect. In the case for additions, we consider the three possible forms of an addition: adding 0 to another expression, an expression to 0, and two arbitrary expressions. In each case, we use the induction hypothesis `H0`, `H1`, or `H2` to show that the optimization does not change the result of the evaluation.</s>

In this Coq script, we define an inductive type `AExp` for arithmetic expressions, consisting of constants, variables, and additions. We then define an evaluator `eval` that takes an expression and an environment (represented as a function from strings to numbers) and returns the result of evaluating the expression in the given environment.

Next, we define an optimizer `optimize` that takes an expression and returns an equivalent expression with all additions by 0 removed. The proof `optimize_preserves_semantics` shows that the optimization does not change the result of the evaluation, i.e., `eval (optimize e) env = eval e env` for all expressions `e` and environments `env`.

The proof is by structural induction on the expression `e`. The base cases for constants and variables are trivial, as optimizing them has no effect. In the case for additions, we consider the three possible forms of an addition: adding 0 to another expression, an expression to 0, and two arbitrary expressions. In each case, we use the induction hypothesis `H0`, `H1`, or `H2` to show that the optimization does not change the result of the evaluation.

In this Coq script, we define an ADT for arithmetic expressions called `AExp`. It has three constructors: `AConst` for constants, `AVar` for variables, and `AAdd` for binary additions.

The `eval` function takes an arithmetic expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to numbers) and returns the number resulting from evaluating the expression in the given environment.

The `optimize` function takes an arithmetic expression and returns an expression with all additions by 0 removed. This is done by recursively optimizing sub-expressions and removing `AAdd` constructors where one of the sub-expressions is `AConst 0`.

Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function. This is done by induction on the structure of the expression, and then simplifying the resulting equality using the induction hypothesis. The theorem states that if `eval (optimize e) env1 = eval e env2` holds for all environments `env1` and `env2`, then for all variables `x`, `env1 x = env2 x`. This means that the optimized expression behaves the same as the original expression with respect to all environments.</s>

In this Coq code, we first define an ADT for arithmetic expressions. `Expr` is defined as a variant type with three constructors: `Const` for constants, `Var` for variables, and `Add` for binary addition. 

We then define the `env` function that takes a string and returns a natural number. This is a simple environment that maps the strings "x", "y", and "z" to the natural numbers 3, 2, and 1, respectively, and maps all other strings to 0.

The `eval` function is a recursive function that evaluates an arithmetic expression given an environment. It uses pattern matching to handle each constructor of the `Expr` type.

The `optimizer` function removes all additions by 0 from an arithmetic expression. It also uses pattern matching to handle each constructor of the `Expr` type.

Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the evaluation function by proving the theorem `optimizer_correct`. We do this by induction on the structure of the input expression. The proof consists of several `simpl` and `reflexivity` tactics to simplify the goal and then prove it by reflexivity.</s>

This Coq script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator, an optimizer, and a lemma showing that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions. The lemma `optimizer_semantics` states that for all arithmetic expressions `e` and environments `env`, the evaluation of the optimized expression `optimizer e` is equal to the evaluation of the original expression `e`.

The above Coq script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator function, an optimizer function, and a theorem stating that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions.

The ADT is defined as an inductive type `Expr` with three constructors: `Const` for constants, `Var` for variables, and `Add` for addition.

The evaluator `eval` takes an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returns the number resulting from the evaluation of the expression in the given environment.

The optimizer `opt` takes an expression and returns an expression with all additions by 0 removed.

The theorem `opt_preserves_semantics` states that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions, i.e., it doesn't change the result of the evaluation. It is proven by structural induction on the expression.</s>

In this Coq script, we define an inductive type `Expr` for arithmetic expressions. The constructors are `Const` for constants, `Var` for variables, and `Add` for additions. We then define two functions `eval` and `optimize` on these expressions. The `eval` function takes an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returns the number resulting from evaluation. The `optimize` function takes an expression and returns an expression with all additions by 0 removed. We then prove that the `optimize` function preserves the semantics as defined by the `eval` function, i.e., for any expression `e` and any environment `env`, `eval (optimize e) env = eval e env`.</s>

This script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator, an optimizer, and a theorem that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions.

The evaluator `eval` recursively evaluates an arithmetic expression given an environment. It pattern matches on the input expression, and if it is a constant, it returns the constant's value. If it is a variable, it looks up the variable's value in the environment. If it is an addition, it recursively evaluates the two sub-expressions and adds their values.

The optimizer `optimize` recursively optimizes an arithmetic expression. It pattern matches on the input expression, and if it is an addition where one of the sub-expressions is 0, it removes that sub-expression. Otherwise, it recursively optimizes the sub-expressions of the addition.

The theorem `optimizer_preserves_semantics` states that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions. It does this by structural induction on the input expression. In the base cases for constants and variables, the theorem is trivially true because the optimizer doesn't change these expressions. In the case for additions, the theorem uses the induction hypotheses for the sub-expressions and the fact that addition with 0 is the identity to prove that the optimized expression has the same value as the original expression under the given environment.</s>

This script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator, an optimizer, and a theorem that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions.

The evaluator `eval` recursively evaluates an arithmetic expression given an environment. It pattern matches on the input expression, and if it is a constant, it returns the constant's value. If it is a variable, it looks up the variable's value in the environment. If it is an addition, it recursively evaluates the two sub-expressions and adds their values.

The optimizer `optimize` recursively optimizes an arithmetic expression. It pattern matches on the input expression, and if it is an addition where one of the sub-expressions is 0, it removes that sub-expression. Otherwise, it recursively optimizes the sub-expressions of the addition.

The theorem `optimizer_preserves_semantics` states that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions. It does this by structural induction on the input expression. In the base cases for constants and variables, the theorem is trivially true because the optimizer doesn't change these expressions. In the case for additions, the theorem uses the induction hypotheses for the sub-expressions and the fact that addition with 0 is the identity to prove that the optimized expression has the same value as the original expression under the given environment.

In this Coq script, we first define an inductive type `ArithExpr` to represent arithmetic expressions. We then define the evaluator `eval` that takes an arithmetic expression and an environment (a function from strings to natural numbers), and evaluates the expression in the given environment.

Next, we define the optimizer `opt` that takes an arithmetic expression and removes all additions by 0. We do this using a fixpoint, which is a general form of recursion.

Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions, by proving the theorem `opt_preserves_eval`. This theorem states that for all arithmetic expressions `e` and environments `env`, the evaluation of the optimized expression `opt e` is equal to the evaluation of the original expression `e`. We prove this by structural induction on `e`.</s>

In this Coq script, we first define the `Expr` inductive type for arithmetic expressions. Then we define the `eval` function that evaluates an expression in a given environment. We also define the `opt` function that optimizes an expression by removing additions by 0. Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the evaluation function, i.e., `eval (opt e) env = eval e env` for all expressions `e` and environments `env`.

This script defines an ADT for arithmetic expressions, an evaluator, an optimizer that removes additions by 0, and a theorem that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the evaluator.

The `AExp` type represents arithmetic expressions. It is defined as an inductive type with three constructors: `AE_const` for constants, `AE_var` for variables, and `AE_add` for binary additions.

The `eval` function is the evaluator. It takes an arithmetic expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to numbers), and returns the number resulting from the evaluation of the arithmetic expression in the given environment.

The `opt` function is the optimizer. It takes an arithmetic expression and returns an optimized arithmetic expression where all additions by 0 have been removed. The optimization is performed using a fixpoint, which recursively applies the optimization to the sub-expressions of the given arithmetic expression.

The `opt_preserves_eval` theorem states that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the evaluator. It is proved by structural induction on the input arithmetic expression. The base cases for constants and variables are trivial, as they do not involve any additions by 0. The inductive case for additions by 0 is proved using reflexivity and the induction hypotheses for the sub-expressions, as well as the fact that addition by 0 is the identity for addition.</s>

- We define an inductive type (ADT) `Expr` for arithmetic expressions. It comprises constructors for constants (natural numbers), variables (identified by strings), and binary addition.
- We define the function `eval` that evaluates an expression by recursively evaluating its sub-expressions and adding the results. It takes an expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to numbers) as arguments.
- We define the function `optimize` that optimizes an arithmetic expression by recursively optimizing its sub-expressions and removing additions by 0.
- We prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the evaluation function by proving the theorem `optimize_preserves_eval`. The theorem states that for any expression `e` and environment `env`, the evaluation of the optimized expression `optimize e` is equal to the evaluation of the original expression `e`. We prove this theorem by structural induction on the expression `e`. The base cases handle constants and variables, where the optimization does not change the evaluation. The inductive cases handle binary addition, where we use the associativity and commutativity of addition to rewrite the evaluation of the optimized expression in terms of the original one, and then apply the induction hypotheses `IH1` and `IH2` to prove the theorem for the sub-expressions.</s>

In this Coq script, we first define an inductive type `ArithExpr` to represent arithmetic expressions. Then we define the `eval` function that takes an arithmetic expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to natural numbers) and returns the result of evaluating the expression in the given environment.

Next, we define the `optimizer` function that takes an arithmetic expression and returns an optimized version of the expression where all additions by 0 are removed. We do this by pattern matching on the structure of the input expression and recursively applying the optimizer to its subexpressions.

Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions by defining a theorem `optimizer_preserves_semantics` and proving it by induction on the structure of the input expression. This theorem states that for all arithmetic expressions and environments, the evaluation of the optimized expression is equal to the evaluation of the original expression.</s>

In this Coq script, we first define an inductive type `ArithExpr` to represent arithmetic expressions. Then we define the `eval` function that takes an arithmetic expression and an environment (a function that maps variable names to natural numbers) and returns the result of evaluating the expression in the given environment.

Next, we define the `optimizer` function that takes an arithmetic expression and returns an optimized version of the expression where all additions by 0 are removed. We do this by pattern matching on the structure of the input expression and recursively applying the optimizer to its subexpressions.

Finally, we prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the expressions by defining a theorem `optimizer_preserves_semantics` and proving it by induction on the structure of the input expression. This theorem states that for all arithmetic expressions and environments, the evaluation of the optimized expression is equal to the evaluation of the original expression.

In the Coq script above, we first define the Arithmetic expressions (ArithExpr) as a variant type with three constructors: Const for constants, Var for variables and Add for binary addition.

The Environment is defined as a function that takes a string (the variable name) and returns a natural number (the value of the variable). Here, we have a simple environment with two variables "x" and "y", and it returns 10 for "x", 20 for "y", and 0 for any other variable.

The Evaluator function, eval, recursively evaluates an arithmetic expression based on the constructors of ArithExpr.

The Optimizer function, optimize, also recursively processes the arithmetic expressions. It removes additions by 0.

The lemma optimize_preserves_eval states that the optimization process does not affect the semantics of the expressions, i.e., the evaluation of an optimized expression is the same as that of the original expression. We prove this lemma by structural induction on the Arithmetic expressions.</s>

This proof relies on the induction hypothesis `IH`, which states that the property holds for `e2` and `e1` respectively. We then use `rewrite` to substitute these induction hypotheses into the goal, and finish the proof with `now rewrite`. The last `reflexivity` takes care of the base case.

Note that the `Admitted` command was removed from the end of the file. This command is used when a proof is incomplete or not yet written, and it tells Coq to accept the statement as true without a proof.

### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

```The proof for `optimize_preserves_semantics` is a bit tricky. We need to consider the three cases for `Add`: adding 0 to something, something to 0, and two arbitrary expressions.

Here is the complete proof:
