You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

CHOSEN SOLUTION

<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.
<</SYS>>

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: hauto lq: on

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.
