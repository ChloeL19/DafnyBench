Here, we first define the `repeat` function that creates a list of length `n` with all elements equal to `x`. We then prove two lemmas: `repeat_length` checks that the length of the list returned by `repeat` is `n`, and `repeat_elements` checks that all elements of the list returned by `repeat` are `x`. We do this by induction on `n`. In the base case, we show that the list is empty, which has length `0`. In the inductive case, we use the inductive hypothesis to show that the length of the list is `S n'` and that all elements are `x`.</s>

In the first part, `repeat` is defined as a recursive function that returns a list of length `n` with all elements being `x`.

In the second lemma `repeat_length`, we prove that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`. We use induction on `n` and in the base case, we directly show that the length of `nil` is `0`. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` that the length of the tail `(repeat x n')` is `n'` and then the length of the list `x :: (repeat x n')` is `S n'` by simplifying the `cons` constructor.

In the third lemma `repeat_elements`, we prove that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x`. We use induction on the element `y` and in the base case, we discriminate `In_y` because `y` is not in the empty list. In the inductive case, we discriminate `In_y` if `n` is `0`. If `n` is `S n'`, we use the induction hypothesis `Hn'` that every element of `(repeat x n')` is `x` and then show that `y` is `x` by rewriting `Hn'` and using reflexivity.</s>

(1) The `repeat` function is defined using Coq's `Fixpoint` keyword. It takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, and recursively constructs a list of length `n` with all elements equal to `x`. If `n` is 0, it returns the empty list (`nil`). Otherwise, it conses `x` onto the front of the result of recursively calling `repeat` with `x` and `n'`, where `n'` is `n` minus 1.

(2) The `repeat_length` lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case for induction is when `n` is 0, where the length of the result of `repeat x 0` is clearly 0, so we use the `reflexivity` tactic. In the inductive case, we use the `simpl` tactic to simplify the goal, which will be `length (x :: repeat x n') = S n'`, and then we rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, which states `length (repeat x n') = n'`. After rewriting, the goal becomes `length (x :: repeat x n') = S n'`, which is true by definition of `length`.

(3) The `repeat_elements` lemma is proved in a similar way. The base case for induction is when `n` is 0, where the `For_all` statement is vacuously true because there are no elements in the empty list. In the inductive case, we use the `simpl` tactic to simplify the goal, which will be `For_all (fun y => y = x) (x :: repeat x n')`. We then apply the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the rest of the list `repeat x n'`, and use the `reflexivity` tactic to finish the proof.</s>

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The function `repeat` is defined by induction on the natural number `n`. When `n` is 0, it returns the empty list `nil`. Otherwise, it conses `x` onto the front of the list `repeat x (n-1)`.

2. The lemma `length_repeat` is proven by induction on `n`. When `n` is 0, the length of `repeat x 0` is 0, which is equal to `n` by reflexivity. Otherwise, we first simplify the term `repeat x (S n')` and then use the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` to reason about the length of `repeat x n'`.

3. The lemma `elements_repeat` is proven by induction on `n`. When `n` is 0, the `Forall` statement is vacuously true because there are no elements in the empty list. Otherwise, we first construct a proof that `x = x` holds (by applying `IHn'`), and then use this proof to construct a proof that `y = x` holds for any `y` in the list `repeat x (S n')`.</s>

In this Coq script:

1. The `repeat` function is defined using the `Fixpoint` keyword. This function takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, and returns a list of `n` elements, all of which are `x`.

2. The `length_repeat` lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case for `n = 0` is straightforward, as the length of the empty list is `0`. The inductive case is proved by simplifying the expression for `repeat`, which is a recursive call to `repeat` with `n'` instead of `n`. Then, it uses the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` that the length of the recursive call is `n'`.

3. The `repeat_all_x` lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case for `n = 0` is proved using the `constructor` tactic, which introduces the `Forall` goal with a fresh variable. The inductive case is proved by simplifying the expression for `repeat`, which is a recursive call to `repeat` with `n'` instead of `n`. Then, it applies the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` to the recursive call and uses the `constructor` tactic again to introduce the `Forall` goal. Finally, it uses the `reflexivity` tactic to close the goal.</s>

In this Coq script:

1. The `repeat` function is defined using the `Fixpoint` keyword. This function takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, and returns a list of `n` elements, all of which are `x`.

2. The `length_repeat` lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case for `n = 0` is straightforward, as the length of the empty list is `0`. The inductive case is proved by simplifying the expression for `repeat`, which is a recursive call to `repeat` with `n'` instead of `n`. Then, it uses the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` that the length of the recursive call is `n'`.

3. The `repeat_all_x` lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case for `n = 0` is proved using the `constructor` tactic, which introduces the `Forall` goal with a fresh variable. The inductive case is proved by simplifying the expression for `repeat`, which is a recursive call to `repeat` with `n'` instead of `n`. Then, it applies the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` to the recursive call and uses the `constructor` tactic again to introduce the `Forall` goal. Finally, it uses the `reflexivity` tactic to close the goal.

Here, `repeat` is the function that repeats the input `x` for `n` times. The function is defined using a recursive pattern matching on the input `n`. If `n` is 0, then it returns the empty list, otherwise, it adds `x` to the front of the list and recursively calls `repeat` with `n'` and `x`.

`repeat_length` is a lemma that checks the length of the list returned by `repeat` is equal to `n`. It's proved by induction on `n`. For `n = 0`, the length of the empty list is 0, which is equal to `n = 0`. For `n = S n'`, we know that `repeat x (S n')` returns `x :: repeat x n'`. By the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, `repeat x n'` has length `n'`, so `x :: repeat x n'` has length `S n'`, which is equal to `n = S n'`.

`repeat_elements` is a lemma that checks every element in the list returned by `repeat` is `x`. It's proved by induction on the proof that `y` is in the list. If `y` is not in the list, then it's trivially equal to `x`. Otherwise, by the induction hypothesis `HIH`, every element in `repeat x n'` (which is the tail of the list `repeat x (S n')`) is `x`, so `y` (which is the head of the list `repeat x (S n')`) is also `x`.</s>

Here, `repeat` is the function that repeats the input `x` for `n` times. The function is defined using a recursive pattern matching on the input `n`. If `n` is 0, then it returns the empty list, otherwise, it adds `x` to the front of the list and recursively calls `repeat` with `n'` and `x`.

`repeat_length` is a lemma that checks the length of the list returned by `repeat` is equal to `n`. It's proved by induction on `n`. For `n = 0`, the length of the empty list is 0, which is equal to `n = 0`. For `n = S n'`, we know that `repeat x (S n')` returns `x :: repeat x n'`. By the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, `repeat x n'` has length `n'`, so `x :: repeat x n'` has length `S n'`, which is equal to `n = S n'`.

`repeat_elements` is a lemma that checks every element in the list returned by `repeat` is `x`. It's proved by induction on the proof that `y` is in the list. If `y` is not in the list, then it's trivially equal to `x`. Otherwise, by the induction hypothesis `HIH`, every element in `repeat x n'` (which is the tail of the list `repeat x (S n')`) is `x`, so `y` (which is the head of the list `repeat x (S n')`) is also `x`.

The `repeat` function builds a list by appending `x` to the front of a recursive call to `repeat`. It stops when `n` is `0`, at which point it returns the empty list `nil`. 

The `repeat_length` lemma is proven by induction on `n`. In the base case, it's straightforward to show that the length of the empty list is `0`. In the inductive case, we first show that `S (length (repeat x n')) = length (x :: repeat x n')`, then rewrite the goal using this equality and the induction hypothesis, and finally prove the goal by reflexivity.

The `repeat_elements` lemma is proven by a similar induction on `n`. In the base case, we directly use `inversion` to show that `y` can't be in the empty list, so it must be equal to `x`. In the inductive case, we first `simpl`ify the goal and `destruct` the proof that `y` is in the list. If `y` is the first element of the list, then it must be equal to `x` by reflexivity.

In the above Coq script:

1. The function `repeat` is defined using a recursive pattern matching on the input `n`. If `n` is `0`, the function returns an empty list. If `n` is `S n'`, the function returns a list that starts with `x` and continues with the result of `repeat x n'`.

2. The lemma `length_repeat` is proven by induction on `n`. The base case (`0`) is straightforward, as the length of the empty list is `0`. The inductive case (`S n'`) is proven using the induction hypothesis (`IHn'`) and the `simpl` and `rewrite` tactics.

3. The lemma `repeat_all_x` is proven by induction on `n`. The base case (`0`) is proven by inverting the `In` predicate (`inversion H`) and then showing that `y` must be equal to `x`. The inductive case (`S n'`) is proven by `simpl`, `rewrite`, and then applying the induction hypothesis (`IHn'`).</s>

The lemma `repeat_length` is proved by induction on `n`. In the base case, we show that the length of the list produced by `repeat` when `n` is 0 is 0.

In this script, we define a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.

We then prove two lemmas:

1. `length_repeat` checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
2. `content_repeat` checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x`.

Both lemmas are proved by induction on `n`. The base case for the `length_repeat` lemma is straightforward: when `n` is 0, `repeat x 0` is `nil`, so its length is 0. For the inductive case, we first simplify the term `repeat x (S n')` to `x :: repeat x n'` (where `n'` is `n` minus 1), then apply the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the tail of the list `repeat x (S n')`. This shows that the length of `repeat x (S n')` is `S n`, as required.

For the `content_repeat` lemma, the base case is also straightforward: when `n` is 0, `repeat x 0` is `nil`, so the predicate `fun y => y = x` holds for all elements of the list. For the inductive case, we first split the list `repeat x (S n')` into its head and tail, then apply the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the tail of the list. This shows that the predicate `fun y => y = x` holds for all elements of `repeat x (S n')`.</s>

This Coq code defines the `repeat` function, which constructs a list of length `n` filled with the element `x`. It then proves two lemmas: `repeat_length`, which states that the length of the list produced by `repeat` is always equal to `n`, and `repeat_elements`, which states that every element of the list produced by `repeat` is equal to `x`.

The proof of `repeat_length` is by induction on `n`. The base case for the induction is when `n = 0`, where we simply show that `length (repeat x 0)` is `0` by reflexivity. In the inductive case, we pattern match on `n` to get `S n'`, and then we rewrite `length (x :: repeat x n')` to `S (length (repeat x n'))` using the induction hypothesis `IHn'`. Since `IHn'` tells us that `length (repeat x n')` is equal to `n'`, we can rewrite `S (length (repeat x n'))` to `S n'` by reflexivity.

The proof of `repeat_elements` is also by induction on `n`. The base case for the induction is when `n = 0`, where we simply show that `For_all (fun y => y = x) nil` holds by constructing the empty list.

In this Coq script,

1. We define the function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`. We do this by recursively building a list that starts with `x` and continues with the result of `repeat x n'`, where `n'` is `n` minus one. If `n` is zero, we return the empty list.

2. We define the lemma `repeat_length` that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat x n` returns a list of length `n`. We do this by induction on `n`. If `n` is zero, the list is empty and thus has length zero. If `n` is `S n'`, then `repeat x n` is `x` consed onto the result of `repeat x n'`, and by the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, `repeat x n'` has length `n'`. Thus, `repeat x n` has length `S n' = n`.

3. We define the lemma `repeat_elements` that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat x n` returns a list where every element is `x`. We do this by induction on `n`. If `n` is zero, the list is empty and thus has every element `x` (vacuously). If `n` is `S n'`, then `repeat x n` is `x` consed onto the result of `repeat x n'`, and by the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, every element of `repeat x n'` is `x`. Thus, every element of `repeat x n` is `x`.</s>

The function `repeat` is defined by recursively consing `x` onto the front of the result of `repeat x n'`, where `n'` is `n` minus one. Base case is when `n` is zero, we return the empty list.

The lemma `length_repeat` is proved by induction on `n`. In the base case, we have `n = O`, so `repeat x O` is `nil`, and its length is obviously zero, so we just use `reflexivity`. In the inductive case, we have `n = S n'`, and by the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, `length (repeat x n') = n'`. After simplifying and rewriting `IHn'`, we get `length (x :: repeat x n') = S n'`, which holds by reflexivity.

The lemma `elements_repeat` is proved by induction on `n`. In the base case, we have `n = O`, so `repeat x O` is `nil`. If `y` is in `nil`, it must be `O`, so we just discard this case by `inversion H`. In the inductive case, we have `n = S n'`, and by the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y = x`. After simplifying and destructing `y`, if `y = x`, we're done by reflexivity, and if `y = x :: repeat x n'`, we discard this case by `inversion H`, and then apply `IHn'` to the remaining case.</s>

In this Coq script, the `repeat` function is defined by pattern matching on the natural number `n`. If `n` is 0, then the result is the empty list. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 0 and `repeat` is called recursively with `n'` being `n` minus 1. The result of the recursive call is then consed with `x`.

The lemma `repeat_length` is proved by induction on `n`. In the base case, it is trivial because the length of the empty list is 0, which is equal to `n` when `n` is 0. In the inductive case, it is shown that the length of the consed list is `S n'` by simplifying the definition of `repeat` and applying the induction hypothesis.

The lemma `repeat_content` is proved by induction on `n` as well. In the base case, it is trivial because the `Forall` statement is true for the empty list. In the inductive case, it is shown that `y` must be equal to `x` for any element `y` in the consed list, by rewriting the `Forall_cons` lemma and showing that `y` is equal to `x` for the head of the list, and that the same holds for the tail of the list by applying the induction hypothesis.</s>

(1) The function `repeat` is defined using Coq's fixpoint. It takes two arguments, `x` of type `A` and `n` of type `nat`. The function returns a list of elements of type `A`, where every element is `x`. If `n` is `O`, the function returns the empty list. If `n` is `S n'`, the function returns a list that starts with `x` and continues with the result of calling `repeat x n'`.

(2) The lemma `repeat_length` checks that for any `x` and `n`, the length of the list returned by `repeat x n` is `n`. The lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is trivial because the length of the empty list is `0`, which is equal to `O`. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to prove that the length of the list returned by `repeat x (S n')` is `S n'`.

(3) The lemma `repeat_content` checks that for any `x` and `n`, the list returned by `repeat x n` contains only `x`. The lemma is proved by generalizing the equation `x = x` and using the `In` predicate to reason about list membership.</s>

(1) The function `repeat` is defined using Coq's fixpoint. It takes two arguments, `x` of type `A` and `n` of type `nat`. The function returns a list of elements of type `A`, where every element is `x`. If `n` is `O`, the function returns the empty list. If `n` is `S n'`, the function returns a list that starts with `x` and continues with the result of calling `repeat x n'`.

(2) The lemma `repeat_length` checks that for any `x` and `n`, the length of the list returned by `repeat x n` is `n`. The lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is trivial because the length of the empty list is `0`, which is equal to `O`. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to prove that the length of the list returned by `repeat x (S n')` is `S n'`.

(3) The lemma `repeat_content` checks that for any `x` and `n`, the list returned by `repeat x n` contains only `x`. The lemma is proved by generalizing the equation `x = x` and using the `In` predicate to reason about list membership.

In this script, we first define the `repeat` function that constructs a list of length `n` filled with the value `x`. Then, we prove two lemmas:

1. `repeat_length` states that for any `x` and `n`, the length of the list returned by `repeat` is `n`.
2. `repeat_content` states that for any `x` and `n`, all elements of the list returned by `repeat` are `x`.

The proof of `repeat_length` is by induction on `n`. The base case for the induction is when `n` is 0, in which case the result of `repeat` is `nil`, and thus has length 0. The inductive step is to show that if `n` is `S n'`, then the length of `repeat x (S n')` is `S n'` (which follows from the inductive hypothesis for `n'`).

The proof of `repeat_content` is also by induction on `n`. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the list is `nil`, and thus has no elements, so the property holds vacuously. The inductive step is to show that if `n` is `S n'`, then all elements of `repeat x (S n')` are `x`. This follows from the inductive hypothesis for `n'` and the fact that the first element of `repeat x (S n')` is `x`.</s>

In this Coq script, we first define the `repeat` function that constructs a list of `n` repetitions of `x`. Then we prove two lemmas: `repeat_length` and `repeat_elements`. 

The `repeat_length` lemma states that the length of the list returned by `repeat` is always equal to `n`. We prove this by induction on `n`. If `n` is `O`, then the list is `nil` and thus has length `O`. If `n` is `S n'`, then the list is `x :: repeat x n'`, and we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to prove that the length of `repeat x n'` is equal to `n'`.

The `repeat_elements` lemma states that for any `y`, if `y` is in the list returned by `repeat`, then `y` is equal to `x`. We prove this by induction on `n`. If `n` is `O`, then the list is `nil`, and thus `y` is not in the list. If `n` is `S n'`, then the list is `x :: repeat x n'`. We use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to prove that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y` is equal to `x`.

Note: We import `Coq.Lists.List` to use the list type and operations, and `ListNotations` for a more convenient notation.</s>

In this Coq script, we first define the `repeat` function that constructs a list of `n` repetitions of `x`. Then we prove two lemmas: `repeat_length` and `repeat_elements`. 

The `repeat_length` lemma states that the length of the list returned by `repeat` is always equal to `n`. We prove this by induction on `n`. If `n` is `O`, then the list is `nil` and thus has length `O`. If `n` is `S n'`, then the list is `x :: repeat x n'`, and we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to prove that the length of `repeat x n'` is equal to `n'`.

The `repeat_elements` lemma states that for any `y`, if `y` is in the list returned by `repeat`, then `y` is equal to `x`. We prove this by induction on `n`. If `n` is `O`, then the list is `nil`, and thus `y` is not in the list. If `n` is `S n'`, then the list is `x :: repeat x n'`. We use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to prove that if `y` is in `repeat x n'`, then `y` is equal to `x`.

Note: We import `Coq.Lists.List` to use the list type and operations, and `ListNotations` for a more convenient notation.

In this code, `repeat` is the function that builds a list with `n` occurrences of `x`. The lemma `repeat_length` checks that the length of the list built by `repeat` is indeed `n`. The lemma `repeat_elements` checks that all elements in the list built by `repeat` are `x`.

The proofs are by induction on `n`. For the base case (`n = 0`), we simply need to show that the length of the empty list is `0`, which is obvious. For the inductive case (`n = S n'`), we need to show that the length of the list built by `repeat` is `S n'`, which follows from the inductive hypothesis (`IHn'`).

For the lemma `repeat_elements`, the base case (`n = 0`) is trivial since the list is empty, so there's nothing to prove. For the inductive case (`n = S n'`), we need to show that all elements in the list are `x`. This follows from the inductive hypothesis (`IHn'`) and the fact that the first element of the list is `x` (by the way the list is built).</s>

Here's the Coq code for the problem:

(1) The function `repeat` is defined as a fixpoint function. It takes a value `x` of type `A` and a natural number `n`. If `n` is 0, it returns the empty list `nil`. Otherwise, it conses `x` onto the front of the list `repeat x n'`, where `n'` is the predecessor of `n`.

(2) The lemma `repeat_length` is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is straightforward, as the length of the empty list `nil` is 0, which is equal to `n` when `n` is 0. In the inductive case, we pattern match on `n` to get `S n'`, then we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the tail of the list `repeat x n'`. The induction hypothesis gives us that `length (repeat x n') = n'`, and since `x :: repeat x n'` is one element longer than `repeat x n'`, its length is `S n'`. Thus, `length (repeat x n) = n`.

(3) The lemma `repeat_elements` is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is similar to the base case of `repeat_length`, where we just need to show that there is no element in the empty list. In the inductive case, we pattern match on `n` to get `S n'`, then we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` on the tail of the list `repeat x n'`. The induction hypothesis gives us that every element in `repeat x n'` is equal to `x`. We then rewrite `H0` with this equality and get that `y` is equal to `x`, which concludes the proof.</s>

In this Coq script,

- `repeat` is a function that takes an element `x` and a natural number `n`, and constructs a list of length `n` where every element is `x`. It is defined by recursion on `n`. If `n` is 0, it returns the empty list. Otherwise, it conses `x` onto the front of `repeat x (n-1)`.

- `repeat_length` is a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat x n` has length `n`. It is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is when `n` is 0, where the length of `repeat x 0` is clearly 0. In the inductive case, we first simplify the goal and rewrite with the induction hypothesis. The goal then becomes `S (length (repeat x n')) = S n'`, which is true by definition of `length`.

- `repeat_content` is a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, every element in `repeat x n` is `x`. It is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is when `n` is 0, where there are no elements in the list, so the statement is vacuously true. In the inductive case, we first simplify the goal and destruct the `In` statement. If `y` is the first element of the list, then `y = x` by the induction hypothesis. Otherwise, we apply the induction hypothesis to the tail of the list.</s>

The `repeat` function is a recursive function that constructs a list by adding `x` to the front `n` times. Base case is when `n = 0`, we return the empty list `nil`. Inductive case is when `n` is a successor, we add `x` to the front of the list `repeat x n'`, where `n'` is `n` predecessor.

The lemma `length_repeat` states that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`. This is proved by induction on `n`. Base case is when `n = 0`, the length of the empty list is `0`, so we reflexivity. Inductive case is when `n` is a successor. We pattern match on `n` to get `n'` and the inductive hypothesis `IHn'`. We then simplify the goal, rewrite `IHn'`, and reflexivity.

The lemma `content_repeat` states that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x`. This is proved by induction on `n`.

We construct a list with `x` at the front, so we apply the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` to show that every element in the tail of the list is `x`.</s>

In this Coq script, I first defined a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`. This function is defined using pattern matching on `n`.

Next, I defined a lemma `length_repeat` that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`. The proof of this lemma is by induction on `n`. The base case is straightforward, as the length of `nil` is `0`. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that the length of `x :: repeat x n'` is `S n'`.

Finally, I defined a lemma `content_repeat` that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x`. The proof of this lemma is also by induction on `n`. In both the base case and the inductive case, we use the `constructor` tactic to introduce the universal quantification and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that every element of `x :: repeat x n'` is `x`.</s>

In this Coq script, I first defined a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`. This function is defined using pattern matching on `n`.

Next, I defined a lemma `length_repeat` that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`. The proof of this lemma is by induction on `n`. The base case is straightforward, as the length of `nil` is `0`. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that the length of `x :: repeat x n'` is `S n'`.

Finally, I defined a lemma `content_repeat` that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every element is `x`. The proof of this lemma is also by induction on `n`. In both the base case and the inductive case, we use the `constructor` tactic to introduce the universal quantification and then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that every element of `x :: repeat x n'` is `x`.

In this Coq script, we define the `repeat` function using a recursive pattern matching on the natural number `n`. If `n` is `O`, we return the empty list (`nil`). If `n` is `S n'`, we return a list that starts with `x` and continues with the result of `repeat x n'`.

For the inductive case (`S n'`), we first use the `simpl` tactic to simplify the goal, then rewrite the induction hypothesis `IHn'` and use `reflexivity` to finish the proof.

We prove the `repeat_elements` lemma by induction on `n` and a dependent existential quantification on the element `y`. If `n` is `O`, we have an empty list and there is no element in the list to prove anything about, so we use the `now` tactic to close the goal.

We then rewrite `H'` in `H` and use `reflexivity` to finish the proof.</s>

The first function `repeat` is a recursive function that constructs a list by consing `x` onto the front of the result of recursively calling `repeat` with `x` and `n'-1`. When `n` is `0`, it returns the empty list.

The second lemma `repeat_length` is proven by induction on `n`. The base case is trivial because the length of the empty list is `0`, which is equal to `n` when `n` is `0`. The inductive case is proved by simplifying the `length` of the cons operation and then applying the induction hypothesis.

The third lemma `repeat_elements` is proven by induction on `n`. The base case is proved by inverting the `In` clause of the list and then showing that the only possible element of the empty list is `x` itself, so `y` must be `x`. The inductive case is proved by inverting the `In` clause of the cons operation and then applying the induction hypothesis.</s>

We then prove two lemmas about `repeat`: `repeat_length` which states that the length of the list produced by `repeat` is always `n`, and `repeat_elements` which states that every element in the list produced by `repeat` is `x`.

This Coq script provides a solution to your problem. 

The `repeat` function is a recursive function that constructs a list by adding `x` to the front `n` times. The base case is when `n = 0`, we return the empty list `nil`. In the inductive case, we add `x` to the front of the list constructed by the recursive call with `n'`, which is `n` decremented by 1.

The `repeat_length` lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is when `n = 0`, where the length of the list constructed by `repeat` is 0, so we use `reflexivity` to conclude. In the inductive case, we pattern match on the list constructed by `repeat`, where we know by the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` that its length is `n'`. Since `n` is `S n'`, we just need to show that `S (Length (repeat x n')) = n`, which follows from the definition of addition.

The `repeat_content` lemma is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is when `n = 0`, where the list constructed by `repeat` is empty, so we use `constructor` to introduce the empty list and `Forall_nil` to conclude that all elements in the empty list are `x`. In the inductive case, we pattern match on the list constructed by `repeat`, where we know by the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` that all elements are `x`. Since we added `x` to the front of the list in the recursive call, we use `Forall_cons` to introduce `x` and conclude with `reflexivity`.</s>

In the above Coq script, we first import the List module. We then define the function `repeat` that creates a list of length `n` filled with the value `x`. We proceed by structural induction on `n`. If `n` is 0, we return the empty list `nil`. If `n` is `S n'`, we return a list that starts with `x` and continues with the result of `repeat x n'`.

We then prove the two lemmas. The first lemma, `length_repeat`, states that the length of the list produced by `repeat` is always equal to `n`. This is proved by induction on `n`. If `n` is 0, then the length of the list is 0, so we use reflexivity. If `n` is `S n'`, then the length of the list is `S (Length (repeat x n'))` by the inductive hypothesis `IHn'`.

The second lemma, `elements_repeat`, states that every element in the list produced by `repeat` is equal to `x`. This is proved by induction on `n`. If `n` is 0, then the list is empty and the statement is vacuously true. If `n` is `S n'`, then by the inductive hypothesis `IHn'`, every element in the tail of the list is equal to `x`. The head of the list is also `x`, so the statement is true for `S n'`.</s>

In the above Coq script, we first import the List module. We then define the function `repeat` that creates a list of length `n` filled with the value `x`. We proceed by structural induction on `n`. If `n` is 0, we return the empty list `nil`. If `n` is `S n'`, we return a list that starts with `x` and continues with the result of `repeat x n'`.

We then prove the two lemmas. The first lemma, `length_repeat`, states that the length of the list produced by `repeat` is always equal to `n`. This is proved by induction on `n`. If `n` is 0, then the length of the list is 0, so we use reflexivity. If `n` is `S n'`, then the length of the list is `S (Length (repeat x n'))` by the inductive hypothesis `IHn'`.

The second lemma, `elements_repeat`, states that every element in the list produced by `repeat` is equal to `x`. This is proved by induction on `n`. If `n` is 0, then the list is empty and the statement is vacuously true. If `n` is `S n'`, then by the inductive hypothesis `IHn'`, every element in the tail of the list is equal to `x`. The head of the list is also `x`, so the statement is true for `S n'`.

Here, the `repeat` function is defined by recursion on the input natural number `n`. If `n` is 0, it returns the empty list `nil`. Otherwise, it conses `x` onto the result of `repeat x (n-1)`.

The lemma `repeat_length` is proved by induction on `n`. The base case for `0` is straightforward: the length of the empty list is `0`, which is equal to `n` by reflexivity. In the inductive case, we use `simpl` to break down the `repeat x (S n')` to `x :: repeat x n'`. Then, we rewrite `IHn'` (the inductive hypothesis for `n'`) and apply reflexivity.

The lemma `repeat_content` is proved by induction on the input list `l`. If `l` is the empty list, we have a contradiction if there exists any `y` in `l`, since `l` is `nil`. Otherwise, we have `y :: l'` as the list. We use `simpl` to break down the `repeat x (S n')` to `x :: repeat x n'`. Then, we use `inversion` to case-split on the equality `l = repeat x n`. We apply `IHl'` and `H` to the subgoal.</s>

In this Coq script:

In this code:

1. The `repeat` function is defined by recursion on the input `n`. If `n` is `0`, the result is an empty list `[]`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by `1` and `x` is consed to the front of the list.

2. The `repeat_length` lemma is proven by induction on `n`. The base case (`0`) is proved by reflexivity, as the length of an empty list is `0`. The inductive case is proved by simplifying the goal, using the inductive hypothesis `IHn'` that `length (repeat x n') = n'` to rewrite the goal, and then proving the goal by reflexivity.

3. The `repeat_content` lemma is proven by induction on the element `y` of the list `repeat x n`. If `y` is `x`, the lemma is proved by reflexivity. Otherwise, `y` is an element of the tail of the list `repeat x n'`, so the lemma is proved by simplifying the goal, rewriting the goal using the inductive hypothesis `H'`, and then proving the goal by reflexivity.</s>

In this Coq script:

1. The `repeat` function is defined as a recursive function that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n`. If `n` is `0`, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it constructs a new list with `x` as the first element and the rest of the list is obtained by calling `repeat` on `x` and `n'` (`n` decremented by one).

2. The `repeat_length` lemma states that for any `x` and `n`, the length of the list returned by `repeat x n` is equal to `n`. It is proved by induction on `n`. The base case (`0`) is straightforward: the length of `repeat x 0` is `0`, as it is an empty list. For the inductive case (`S n'`), we first simplify the term `repeat x (S n')`, which gives us `x :: repeat x n'`. Then we rewrite `repeat x n'` using the inductive hypothesis `IHn'`, which states that its length is `n'`. Thus, the length of the whole list is `S n'`, as desired.

3. The `repeat_content` lemma states that for any `x` and `n`, every element of the list returned by `repeat x n` is equal to `x`. It is proved by induction on `n`. The base case (`0`) is vacuously true, as there are no elements in the empty list. For the inductive case (`S n'`), we first construct a proof that `x = x` holds, and then we use `IHn'` to extend this proof to the list `repeat x n'`. Thus, every element of `repeat x (S n')` is equal to `x`, as desired.</s>

In this Coq script, we define the function `repeat` as a recursive function that constructs a list by appending `x` to the result of `repeat x n'`, where `n'` is `n` decremented by one.

The lemma `length_repeat` states that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat x n` is a list of length `n`. We prove this lemma by induction on `n`. The base case is straightforward, as the length of the empty list is zero. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to rewrite the length of `repeat x n'` to `n'`, and then we apply the `reflexivity` tactic to show that the length of `x :: repeat x n'` is `S n'`, which is equal to `n` because `n` is `S n'`.

The lemma `content_repeat` states that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat x n` is a list where every element is `x`. We prove this lemma by induction on `n`. The base case is again straightforward, as the empty list contains no elements. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that every element of `repeat x n'` is `x`, and then we apply the `constructor` tactic to show that the first element of `x :: repeat x n'` is `x`.</s>

In this Coq script, we define the function `repeat` as a recursive function that constructs a list by appending `x` to the result of `repeat x n'`, where `n'` is `n` decremented by one.

The lemma `length_repeat` states that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat x n` is a list of length `n`. We prove this lemma by induction on `n`. The base case is straightforward, as the length of the empty list is zero. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to rewrite the length of `repeat x n'` to `n'`, and then we apply the `reflexivity` tactic to show that the length of `x :: repeat x n'` is `S n'`, which is equal to `n` because `n` is `S n'`.

The lemma `content_repeat` states that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat x n` is a list where every element is `x`. We prove this lemma by induction on `n`. The base case is again straightforward, as the empty list contains no elements. In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that every element of `repeat x n'` is `x`, and then we apply the `constructor` tactic to show that the first element of `x :: repeat x n'` is `x`.

This is the Coq code for the specification.

1. The `repeat` function is a fixpoint function that constructs a list by consing `x` onto the result of `repeat x n'`, where `n'` is `n` minus one. Base case is when `n` is zero, it returns the empty list.

2. The `repeat_length` lemma is proven by induction on `n`. The base case is trivial since the length of `nil` is zero, which is equal to `0`. In the induction step, we know that `Length (repeat x n') = n'` from the induction hypothesis. Since `x :: repeat x n'` is one element longer than `repeat x n'`, its length is `S n'`. Hence, `Length (repeat x n) = n` holds.

3. The `repeat_elements` lemma is proven by induction on `n`. The base case is trivial since the `Forall` statement is vacuously true for the empty list. In the induction step, we know from the induction hypothesis that `Forall (fun y => x = y) (repeat x n')` holds. To prove `Forall (fun y => x = y) (x :: repeat x n')`, we split it into two subgoals: one for `x` and one for `repeat x n'`. The first subgoal is trivial since `x = x` holds. The second subgoal is proven by applying the induction hypothesis `IHn'`. Hence, `Forall (fun y => x = y) (repeat x n)` holds.</s>

In this Coq script, the function `repeat` is defined in line 3. It takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, and returns a list of length `n` with all elements equal to `x`. The function is defined by pattern matching on `n`. If `n` is `0`, then the result is the empty list `[]`. Otherwise, `n` is of the form `S n'`, which means `n` is a successor of `n'`, and the result is `x :: repeat x n'` (i.e., `x` consed onto the list `repeat x n'`).

In this Coq script, we define the `repeat` function by calling the built-in `repeat_nat` function from `Coq.Lists.List`. We then prove two lemmas: `repeat_length` and `repeat_elements`.

The `repeat_length` lemma states that for any `x` and `n`, the length of the list returned by `repeat x n` is `n`. We prove this lemma by induction on `n`. The base case is straightforward: when `n` is 0, the length of the list is 0 by reflexivity. In the inductive case, we first simplify the term we're trying to prove, then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to prove that the length of the tail of the list is `n'`. Finally, we rewrite `IHn'` and prove the goal by reflexivity.

The `repeat_elements` lemma states that for any `x` and `n`, every element of the list returned by `repeat x n` is `x`. We prove this lemma by induction on `n`. The base case is again straightforward: when `n` is 0, the list is empty, so the `Forall` statement is vacuously true. In the inductive case, we first simplify the term we're trying to prove, then use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to prove that every element of the tail of the list is `x`. Finally, we rewrite `IHn'` and prove the goal by reflexivity.</s>

In this Coq code, we first define the `repeat` function which creates a list of length `n` with every element being `x`. We then prove the `repeat_length` lemma, which states that the length of the list returned by `repeat` is always `n`. We do this by induction on `n`, and in the case where `n` is 0, we simply return an empty list, and in the case where `n` is `S n'`, we add `x` to the front of the list returned by `repeat x n'`.

We also prove the `repeat_elements` lemma, which states that every element in the list returned by `repeat` is `x`. We do this by induction on `n`, and in the case where `n` is 0, we simply return an empty list, and in the case where `n` is `S n'`, we add `x` to the front of the list returned by `repeat x n'`.
