 [INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.
<</SYS>>

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: sauto lq: on 


## Context
### Need to show

S (Datatypes.length (List.repeat x n')) = S n'

### given assumptions

x, n', IHn' as follows.

x, n' : nat
IHn' : Datatypes.length (repeat x n') = n'.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: sauto lq: on 


## Context
### Need to show

S (Datatypes.length (List.repeat x n')) = S n'

### given assumptions

X, x, n', IHn' as follows.

X : Type
x : X
n' : nat
IHn' : Datatypes.length (repeat x n') = n'.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out
Replace the hammer tactic with: sfirstorder 


## Context
### Need to show

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactic `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.
To use Coq Hammer effectively, combine it with destruct using `;`: `destruct e1; destruct e2; hammer`.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq:
(1) Write a function `repeat` that takes an integer `x` and a natural number `n` as inputs, and returns a list of length `n` in which every element is `x`.
(2) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list of length `n`.
(3) Write a lemma that checks that for any `x` and `n`, `repeat` returns a list where every elemenis `x`.
### Hint: Import `Coq.Lists.List`.

## Out


## Context
### Need to show

Datatypes.length (repeat x n) = n

### given assumptions

x, n as follows.
