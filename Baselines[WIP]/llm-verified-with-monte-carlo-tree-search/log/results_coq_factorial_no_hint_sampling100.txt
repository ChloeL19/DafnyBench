The factorial function is defined as a recursive function in Coq. The base case is when `n = 0`, we return `1`. For the recursive case, we multiply `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`.

The theorem `factorial_positive` is proven by induction on `n`. In the base case (`n = 0`), we simply use reflexivity to show that `0 <= 1`. In the inductive case, we first simplify the goal by applying `simpl` tactic and `rewrite` tactic with the induction hypothesis (`IHn'`). Then we use `mul_pos_pos` lemma which states that if `0 < a` and `0 < b`, then `0 < a * b`. Since `S n'` is strictly positive (greater than `0`), and by the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, `factorial n'` is strictly positive, hence the result follows.</s>

In this Coq script, we first define a `factorial` function that computes the factorial of a given natural number `n`. This function is defined by pattern matching on `n`. If `n` is `0`, we return `1`. Otherwise, we return `n * factorial n'`, where `n'` is `n - 1`.

Then, we prove that the factorial of any natural number is always strictly positive. This is done by induction on `n`.

The base case for induction is when `n` is `0`. In this case, we have `factorial 0 = 1`, which is obviously positive.

The inductive step is when `n` is `S n'`, i.e., `n` is `n' + 1`. We have `factorial (S n') = n' * factorial n'` by definition. By the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, we know that `factorial n'` is positive. To show that `n' * factorial n'` is positive, we need to show that `n'` and `factorial n'` are both positive and their product is positive. However, since `n'` is a natural number, it is trivially positive. Thus, we just need to show that `factorial n'` is positive. We have already done this in the induction hypothesis `IHn'`. Therefore, by transitivity, `n' * factorial n'` is positive, which completes the inductive step.

Finally, the theorem `factorial_positive` is proved.</s>

The `factorial` function is defined by recursion on its argument `n`. The base case is `0`, for which the factorial is `1`. In the recursive case, we multiply `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`.

The `factorial_positive` theorem is proved by induction on `n`. The base case is trivial, since `0 < 1` holds. In the inductive case, we have `S n' * factorial n' < S n' * S n' * factorial n'` by the induction hypothesis `IHn'`. Since `S n' * S n' = S (S (n' * n'))`, it follows by induction that `S n' * factorial n'` is strictly positive. Therefore, `S n' * factorial n' < S (S (n' * n')) * factorial n'` implies `0 < factorial (S n')`. This concludes the proof.</s>

This Coq script defines a `factorial` function and proves that the factorial is always strictly positive. 

The `factorial` function is defined by recursion on its argument `n`. If `n` is `0`, then `factorial n` is `1`. If `n` is `S n'`, then `factorial n` is `n * factorial n'`.

The `factorial_positive` theorem states that `0 <= factorial n` for all `n`. It is proved by structural induction on `n`. If `n` is `0`, then `factorial 0` is `1`, which is obviously positive. If `n` is `S n'`, then `factorial n` is `n * factorial n'`. By the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, we know that `0 <= factorial n'`. Therefore, `0 <= n * factorial n'` and `0 <= factorial (S n')`. The theorem is proved by `reflexivity`.

In the Coq script above, we first define a `factorial` function. It takes a natural number `n` as input and returns `n!`. The function is defined by pattern matching on `n`. If `n` is `0`, then `n!` is `1`. If `n` is `S n'`, then `n!` is `n * n!`.

Next, we prove that the factorial of any natural number is always strictly positive. We do this by induction on `n`.

The base case is when `n` is `0`. In this case, `factorial 0 = 1`, which is greater than `0`.

The induction step is when `n` is `S n'`. In this case, `factorial n = n * factorial n'`. By the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, we know that `factorial n'` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `n * factorial n'` is also greater than or equal to `0`.

```The factorial function is defined by recursion on its input `n`. If `n` is `0`, the result is `1`. Otherwise, the result is `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`.

To prove that the factorial is always strictly positive, we will use induction on `n`. The base case is when `n = 0`. We can see that `factorial 0 = 1`, which is indeed positive. For the induction step, we assume that `factorial n` is positive, and we need to prove that `factorial (S n)` is also positive.

The lemma `mul_n_gt_0_iff` states that `a * b > 0` if and only if `a > 0` and `b > 0`. We use it to prove that `factorial (S n')` is positive if `factorial n'` and `S n'` are both positive.

The `nat_gt_0_S` lemma states that `n' + 1 > 0`, which is obvious because `n'` is a natural number and `1` is a positive natural number. We use it to prove that `S n'` is positive.

So by induction, we have proved that `factorial n` is always strictly positive.</s>

For the first subgoal, `0 < S n'`, we simply apply the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to `n'`. 

For the second subgoal, `factorial n' > 0`, we simply assume it because it's a hypothesis in the context of the induction step.

In the inductive case, we have `n * factorial n'` for some `n'` smaller than `n`. By the induction hypothesis `IHn`, we know that `factorial n'` is greater than or equal to 0. Since multiplication by a positive number preserves this property, we have `n * factorial n'` is greater than or equal to 0. This concludes the proof.

In this Coq script, we first define the factorial function as a recursive function `factorial`. This function takes a natural number `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`. The base case is when `n = 0`, in which case we return `1`. The recursive case is when `n = S n'`, where `S n'` is the successor of `n'`. In this case, we return `(S n') * factorial n'`.

Next, we prove that the factorial is always strictly positive by defining the theorem `factorial_positive`. This theorem states that for all natural numbers `n`, `0 <= factorial n` holds. We prove this by induction on `n`.

In the base case (`n = 0`), we have `factorial 0 = 1`, and `0 <= 1` is true.

In the inductive case (`n = S n'`), we first simplify the goal by applying the definition of `factorial` to `S n'`. This gives us `S n' * factorial n'`. Then, we rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, which states that `0 <= factorial n'`. The goal now becomes `S n' * 0 <= S n' * factorial n'`, which simplifies to `0 <= factorial n'`. Finally, we apply the lemma `mul_n_pos` which states that if `0 < n` and `0 <= m`, then `0 < n * m`. Since `0 < S n'` and `0 <= factorial n'`, we have `0 < S n' * factorial n'`, as required.</s>

In this Coq script, we define a recursive function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number. The function is defined by pattern matching on the input `n`. If `n` is `0`, we return `1`. Otherwise, we return `n * factorial (n - 1)`.

The theorem `factorial_pos` states that the factorial of any number is strictly positive (greater than or equal to `0`). The proof is by induction on `n`.

- Base case (`n = 0`): The factorial of `0` is `1`, which is clearly positive.
- Inductive step (`n = S n'`): We need to prove that `S n' * factorial n'` is positive. By the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, we know that `factorial n'` is positive. Since multiplication preserves positivity, `S n' * factorial n'` is also positive.

The `Qed` keyword marks the end of the proof, and `reflexivity` and `simpl` are tactics that help automate the proof.</s>

We then prove that the factorial is always strictly positive, i.e., greater than or equal to 0, using a standard induction proof. The induction is done over the natural numbers. For the base case, we simply show that 0 <= 1, which is true by reflexivity. For the inductive case, we first simplify the goal by looking at the recursive case of the factorial function.

In this script, we define a factorial function on natural numbers using Coq's Fixpoint keyword. We then prove that the factorial is always strictly positive using a mathematical induction. The proof is split into two cases: the base case, where n is 0, and the inductive case, where n is the successor of another natural number n'.

In the base case, we simply show that 0 <= 1, which holds by reflexivity.

In the inductive case, we first simplify the goal by applying pattern matching on n. This leaves us with the goal n * factorial n' <= 0. We then rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis IHn', which states that factorial n' is positive. This gives us the goal n * 0 <= 0. We then apply the mul_n_pos lemma, which states that for any natural number n, n * 0 is positive, to show that the goal holds.</s>

Then, we prove that the factorial is always strictly positive using the `Theorem` and `Proof` keywords. We use induction on `n`. In the base case, `0 <= factorial 0` is true because `factorial 0 = 1`, and `0 <= 1` is true. In the inductive case, we have `0 <= factorial (S n')` by the induction hypothesis `IHn'`. Then, we multiply both sides by `S n' + 1` to get `0 <= factorial (S n') * (S n' + 1)`.

The base case for `n = 0` is proved by reflexivity, as the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1, which is obviously greater than 0. The inductive case for `n = S n'` is proved by simplifying the goal (which will rewrite the goal to `S (factorial n') > 0`), then applying the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to the subgoal `factorial n' > 0`, and finally using reflexivity to prove that the successor of a positive number is positive.</s>

- In the base case, where `n` is 0, the factorial is 1, which is obviously positive.
- In the inductive case, we use the induction hypothesis `IHn` that the factorial of `n - 1` is positive. We then apply `mul_pos_pos`, which states that if `a` and `b` are positive, then `a * b` is also positive. This concludes the proof that the factorial is always strictly positive.</s>

```The proof of the theorem "factorial_positive" can be done by induction on the input "n". The base case is when "n" is 0, we show that 0 <= factorial 0, which is true since factorial 0 = 1 and 0 <= 1. For the induction step, we assume that 0 <= factorial n' for some n' and we want to show that 0 <= factorial (S n'). 

From the definition of factorial, we have:

   factorial (S n') = S n' * factorial n'

By the induction hypothesis, we have:

   0 <= factorial n'

Also, we have:

   S n' * factorial n' = S (n' * factorial n')

So, we have:

   0 <= S (n' * factorial n')

Since the product of two positive numbers is positive, we can conclude that:

   0 <= factorial (S n')

Here, we define a `factorial` function on natural numbers. We then prove that the factorial is always strictly positive by induction on `n`. The base case for `n = 0` is straightforward, as `0 <= 1`. For the inductive case, we assume the statement is true for `n'`, and then we need to show that `n * factorial n'` is positive. Since `n` is `S n'`, it is `S n'` plus 1, and hence greater than `n'`. Moreover, by the induction hypothesis, `factorial n'` is positive. Therefore, `n * factorial n'` is the product of two positive numbers and is also positive, concluding the proof.</s>

This Coq script defines a `factorial` function and proves that the factorial of any natural number is always strictly positive.

The `factorial` function is defined by recursion on its argument `n`. The base case is when `n` is `0`, and in this case, the function returns `1`. In the inductive case, `n` is `S n'`, where `S` is the successor function and `n'` is `n - 1`. In this case, the function returns `n * factorial n'`.

The `factorial_positive` theorem states that for all natural numbers `n`, the factorial `factorial n` is always strictly positive, i.e., `0 <= factorial n`. This theorem is proved by induction on `n`.

The base case is when `n = 0`. In this case, the theorem is proved by reflexivity, meaning that `0 <= 1` is true by definition.

In the inductive case, `n = S n'`, the theorem is proved by applying the `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left` lemma and the inductive hypothesis `IHn'`. The `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left` lemma states that if `a <= b` and `0 <= c`, then `a * c <= b * c`. Here, `a` and `b` are `n` and `factorial n'`, `c` is `factorial (S n')`. The inductive hypothesis `IHn'` states that `0 <= factorial n'` and thus `0 <= factorial (S n')`. Finally, the `nat_le_mul_self_right` lemma is applied to prove that `0 <= n * factorial n'`.</s>

In the base case (`0 < factorial 0`), we directly use `reflexivity` because `1` is indeed greater than `0`.

In the inductive case (`0 < factorial n'`), we first `simpl`ify the goal to get rid of the `factorial` definition. Then, we `rewrite` the goal with the induction hypothesis `IHn'`. After simplification, the goal becomes `S n' * factorial n' > 0`, which is equivalent to `n' * factorial n' > 0` by `mul_succ`.

Now we can apply the multiplication strictly positive theorem `mul_gt_0_iff`, which states that for all `n`, `m : nat`, if `n > 0` and `m > 0`, then `n * m > 0`. We split the goal into two subgoals: `lt_succ_self` to prove `n' > 0`, and `IHn'` to prove `factorial n' > 0`.

Finally, the theorem `factorial_positive` is proved. It states that for all `n : nat`, `factorial n` is greater than `0`, i.e., the factorial is always strictly positive.</s>

The factorial function is defined by recursive calls. It takes a natural number `n` and multiplies it with the factorial of `n-1` until `n` is `0`, in which case it returns `1`.

To prove that the factorial is always strictly positive, we need to show that for all `n : nat`, `factorial n` is greater than `0`. We can do this by induction on `n`.

```coq

The `factorial_pos` theorem states that for all natural numbers `n`, `0 < factorial n`. We prove this by induction on `n`.

- Inductive case: We assume the induction hypothesis `IHn'` that `0 < factorial n'`. We have `factorial (S n') = S n' * factorial n'`. By the induction hypothesis, `factorial n'` is positive. Since `S n'` is positive (it is the successor of `n'`, which is a natural number), we have `S n' * factorial n'` is positive, which establishes the inductive step.</s>

In this Coq script, we first define a `factorial` function that takes a natural number `n` as input and returns `n!`. We do this using a recursive definition: if `n` is `0`, then `n! = 1`. Otherwise, `n! = n * (n-1)!`.

Next, we prove a theorem called `factorial_positive`, which states that the factorial of any natural number `n` is strictly positive. To prove this, we first introduce a fresh variable `n` using the `intros` tactic. Then, we perform an induction on `n`.

In the base case, we have `n = 0`. In this case, we know that `0! = 1`, which is indeed positive. So, we just apply the `reflexivity` tactic, which closes the proof.

In the inductive case, we have `n = S n'`, where `S` is the successor function and `n'` is a natural number. We first simplify the goal using the `simpl` tactic, which replaces `n!` with `n * factorial n'` in the goal. Then, we rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, which tells us that `n!' = S n'` is positive. After these rewrites, the goal becomes `n * n' + n` which is clearly positive. Therefore, we can close the proof using the `reflexivity` tactic.</s>

- In the inductive case, we have `n = S n'`, so `factorial n = n * factorial n'`. We simplify this expression and use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` that `factorial n'` is positive. We also need to prove `n` is positive, which is trivial because `n` is a successor of `n'`, i.e., `n = S n' > 0`. 

Finally, we apply the `mul_pos_pos` lemma that states if `a` and `b` are two positive numbers, then `a * b` is also positive. This lemma is already provided by Coq's standard library.</s>

In this Coq code, we first define a `factorial` function that takes a natural number `n` and computes its factorial by recursively multiplying `n` by the factorial of `n-1` until `n` reaches 0. 

Then we prove a theorem `factorial_positive` that states for all natural numbers `n`, the factorial of `n` is always positive. We prove this by induction on `n`. 

- In the base case, we have `n = 0`, so `factorial 0 = 1` which is obviously positive.

- In the inductive case, we have `n = S n'`, so `factorial n = n * factorial n'`. We simplify this expression and use the induction hypothesis `IHn'` that `factorial n'` is positive. We also need to prove `n` is positive, which is trivial because `n` is a successor of `n'`, i.e., `n = S n' > 0`.

This is a proof that the factorial is always strictly positive. It is proven by induction on the input `n`. For the base case `n = 0`, we directly show that `0 <= factorial 0` holds. For the inductive step, we assume the induction hypothesis `IHn'` that `0 <= factorial n'` for some `n'`. Then we compute `factorial (S n') = S n' * factorial n'` by simplification. By the induction hypothesis `IHn'`, we know `0 <= factorial n'`. By `mul_n_gt_0`, we can show `0 <= S n' * factorial n'`, which concludes the inductive step. Hence, by the principle of mathematical induction, `0 <= factorial n` holds for all `n`, and the factorial is always strictly positive.</s>

We then apply `mul_le_mul_left`, which maintains the goal but adds the hypothesis `S n' * S n' <= S n' * S n'` to the context. Since `S n'` is the successor of `n'`, it is greater than or equal to `n'`, so `S n' * S n'` is greater than or equal to `n' * n'`.

The factorial function is defined as a recursive function using the `Fixpoint` keyword. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the factorial is 1. For the inductive case, we multiply `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`.

The proof is done by induction on `n`. For the base case, we show that 0 is non-negative, which is trivial. For the inductive case, we first simplify the goal by performing a case analysis on `n`. Then, we rewrite the goal using the inductive hypothesis `IHn'`. The goal now becomes `S n' * factorial n' >= 0`, which follows from the inductive hypothesis and the fact that multiplication of two positive numbers is positive.
