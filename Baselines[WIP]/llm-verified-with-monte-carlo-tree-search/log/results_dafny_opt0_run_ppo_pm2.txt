### Spec: In Dafny, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.

    }
}
```

Now, we need to prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics. For that, we need to prove that for any expression e and environment env, it holds that Eval(Optimize(e), env) = Eval(e, env). We can do that by structural induction on e.

### Spec: In Dafny, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.



```dafny
datatype Expr =
    | Constant(i: int)
    | Variable(name: string)
    | Add(e1: Expr, e2: Expr)
```

The evaluator:

```dafny
function Eval(e: Expr, env: string -> int): int {
    match e {
        case Constant(i) => i
        case Variable(name) => env(name)
        case Add(e1, e2) => Eval(e1, env) + Eval(e2, env)
    }
}
```

The optimizer:

```dafny
function Optimize(e: Expr): Expr {
    match e {
        case Add(Constant(0), e2) => Optimize(e2)
        case Add(e1, Constant(0)) => Optimize(e1)
        case Add(e1, e2) => Add(Optimize(e1), Optimize(e2))
        case _ => e
    }
}
```

Now, we need to prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics. For that, we need to prove that for any expression e and environment env, it holds that Eval(Optimize(e), env) = Eval(e, env). We can do that by structural induction on e.

```dafny
lemma OptimizePreservesSemantics(e: Expr, env: string -> int)
    ensures Eval(Optimize(e), env) == Eval(e, env)
{
    match e {
        case Constant(_) =>
        case Variable(_) =>
        case Add(e1, e2) =>
            OptimizePreservesSemantics(e1, env);
            OptimizePreservesSemantics(e2, env);
    }
}
```
