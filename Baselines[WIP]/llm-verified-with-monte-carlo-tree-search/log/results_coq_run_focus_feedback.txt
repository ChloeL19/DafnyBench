You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.
### Hint: In the optimizer, recursively optimize the sub-expressions.
### Hint: You can import the `string` datatype with the line `Require Import Coq.Strings.String.`.
### Hint: Use Fixpoint instead of Definition for recursive functions.
### Hint: With tactics like `induction` and `destruct`, _avoid_ naming with `as` and let Coq pick the names for you. For example, use `induction e.` but _not_ `induction e as [...]`.

### Hint: For the proof, do `induction e.`. Do NOT name the hypotheses with `as`.
### Hint: The simple cases are by `simpl. reflexivity.`.
### Hint: The addition case is by `simpl. rewrite <- IHe1. rewrite <- IHe2. destruct (optimize e1); destruct (optimize e2); try destruct n; try destruct n0; eauto using PeanoNat.Nat.add_0_r.`.
### Hint: You'll need `Require Import Arith`.

The error message "Cannot find module ListNotations" indicates that Coq is unable to locate the module named ListNotations. This is likely because the module does not exist in the standard library or in the specified path.

To resolve this issue, you should first verify if the module ListNotations is supposed to be part of another library or if it is a custom-made module. If it is a custom-made module, ensure that the file containing the module is in the correct directory and that you are providing the correct path to it. If the module is not custom-made, you may need to install the required library or adjust your import statements accordingly.</s>

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.
### Hint: In the optimizer, recursively optimize the sub-expressions.
### Hint: You can import the `string` datatype with the line `Require Import Coq.Strings.String.`.
### Hint: Use Fixpoint instead of Definition for recursive functions.
### Hint: With tactics like `induction` and `destruct`, _avoid_ naming with `as` and let Coq pick the names for you. For example, use `induction e.` but _not_ `induction e as [...]`.

### Hint: For the proof, do `induction e.`. Do NOT name the hypotheses with `as`.
### Hint: The simple cases are by `simpl. reflexivity.`.
### Hint: The addition case is by `simpl. rewrite <- IHe1. rewrite <- IHe2. destruct (optimize e1); destruct (optimize e2); try destruct n; try destruct n0; eauto using PeanoNat.Nat.add_0_r.`.

The error message "Cannot find module ListNotations" indicates that Coq is unable to locate the module named ListNotations. This is likely because the module does not exist in the standard library or in the specified path.

To resolve this issue, you should first verify if the module ListNotations is supposed to be part of another library or if it is a custom-made module. If it is a custom-made module, ensure that the file containing the module is in the correct directory and that you are providing the correct path to it.

### Reflection

The error message "Cannot find module ListNotations" indicates that Coq is unable to locate the module named ListNotations. This is likely because the module does not exist in the standard library or in the specified path.

To resolve this issue, you should first verify if the module ListNotations is supposed to be part of another library or if it is a custom-made module. If it is a custom-made module, ensure that the file containing the module is in the correct directory and that you are providing the correct path to it.

You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.
### Hint: In the optimizer, recursively optimize the sub-expressions.
### Hint: You can import the `string` datatype with the line `Require Import Coq.Strings.String.`.
### Hint: Use Fixpoint instead of Definition for recursive functions.
### Hint: With tactics like `induction` and `destruct`, _avoid_ naming with `as` and let Coq pick the names for you. For example, use `induction e.` but _not_ `induction e as [...]`.

### Hint: For the proof, do `induction e.`. Do NOT name the hypotheses with `as`.
### Hint: The simple cases are by `simpl. reflexivity.`.
### Hint: The addition case is by `simpl. rewrite <- IHe1. rewrite <- IHe2. destruct (optimize e1); destruct (optimize e2); try destruct n; try destruct n0; eauto using PeanoNat.Nat.add_0_r.`.
### Hint: You'll need `Require Import Arith`.

### Snippet
Import ListNotations.

### Reflection

The error message "Cannot find module ListNotations" indicates that Coq is unable to locate the module named ListNotations. This is likely because the module does not exist in the standard library or in the specified path.

To resolve this issue, you should first verify if the module ListNotations is supposed to be part of another library or if it is a custom-made module. If it is a custom-made module, ensure that the file containing the module is in the correct directory and that you are providing the correct path to it. If the module is not custom-made, you may need to install the required library or adjust your import statements accordingly.

You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.



You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.
<</SYS>>

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.
### Hint: In the optimizer, recursively optimize the sub-expressions.
### Hint: You can import the `string` datatype with the line `Require Import Coq.Strings.String.`.
### Hint: Use Fixpoint instead of Definition for recursive functions.
### Hint: With tactics like `induction` and `destruct`, _avoid_ naming with `as` and let Coq pick the names for you. For example, use `induction e.` but _not_ `induction e as [...]`.

### Hint: For the proof, do `induction e.`. Do NOT name the hypotheses with `as`.
### Hint: The simple cases are by `simpl. reflexivity.`.
### Hint: The addition case is by `simpl. rewrite <- IHe1. rewrite <- IHe2. destruct (optimize e1); destruct (optimize e2); try destruct n; try destruct n0; eauto using PeanoNat.Nat.add_0_r.`.
### Hint: You'll need `Require Import Arith`.
