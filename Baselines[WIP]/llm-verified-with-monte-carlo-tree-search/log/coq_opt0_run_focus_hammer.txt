## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.
### Hint: In the optimizer, recursively optimize the sub-expressions.
### Hint: You can import the `string` datatype with the line `Require Import Coq.Strings.String.`.
### Hint: Use Fixpoint instead of Definition for recursive functions.
### Hint: When doing the proof, look at the Context to guide you in what you need to prove.
### Hint: For the recursive case, first rewrite <- using the induction hypotheses.
### Hint: Then destruct on the optimized expressions, and combine with ;, with trying to destruct on the numbers, then combine with eauto using PeanoNat.Nat.add_0_r. You'll need the line `Require Import Arith.`.
### Hint: You can do `induction e` for the proof. Do not use `as` because it is tricky to get right.
### Hint: To find the names of the induction hypotheses, look at the assumptions given in the Context.
### Hint: The base cases can be solved by `reflexivity`.
### Hint: The recursive addition case can be solved by first rewriting backwards using `rewrite <-` the inductive hypotheses, and then finishing off with `destruct (optimize e1); destruct (optimize e2); hammer.`

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.
### Hint: In the optimizer, recursively optimize the sub-expressions.
### Hint: You can import the `string` datatype with the line `Require Import Coq.Strings.String.`.
### Hint: Use Fixpoint instead of Definition for recursive functions.
### Hint: When doing the proof, look at the Context to guide you in what you need to prove.
### Hint: For the recursive case, first rewrite <- using the induction hypotheses.
### Hint: Then destruct on the optimized expressions, and combine with ;, with trying to destruct on the numbers, then combine with eauto using PeanoNat.Nat.add_0_r. You'll need the line `Require Import Arith.`.
### Hint: You can do `induction e` for the proof. Do not use `as` because it is tricky to get right.
### Hint: To find the names of the induction hypotheses, look at the assumptions given in the Context.
### Hint: The base cases can be solved by `reflexivity`.
### Hint: The recursive addition case can be solved by first rewriting backwards using `rewrite <-` the inductive hypotheses, and then finishing off with `destruct (optimize e1); destruct (optimize e2); hammer.`

 [INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Coq programmer that writes functional code and prove properties about it. When you are unsure of which lemmas to use, you use the `Search` function, for example `Search (0 < _).`. You can see the output of the Coq verifier in the Out section, and the context of the current proof, comprising the current goal and assumptions, in the Context section. The assumptions have names that you can use in your proofs. Do not repeat the previous mistakes.

You can use Coq Hammer, including the tactics `sauto` and `hammer` to attempt to discharge a goal automatically.

You take a single step and will be given feedback -- listen to the feedback in the instructions.

## Instructions
### Spec: In Coq, write an ADT for arithmetic expressions comprising constants, variables and binary additions. Then write an evaluator taking an expression and an environment (a function that takes a variable name and returns a number) and returning the number resulting from evaluation. Then write an optimizer taking an expression and returning an expression with all additions by 0 removed. Then prove that the optimizer preserves the semantics as defined by the evaluation function.
### Hint: In the optimizer, recursively optimize the sub-expressions.
### Hint: You can import the `string` datatype with the line `Require Import Coq.Strings.String.`.
### Hint: Use Fixpoint instead of Definition for recursive functions.
### Hint: When doing the proof, look at the Context to guide you in what you need to prove.
### Hint: For the recursive case, first rewrite <- using the induction hypotheses.
### Hint: Then destruct on the optimized expressions, and combine with ;, with trying to destruct on the numbers, then combine with eauto using PeanoNat.Nat.add_0_r. You'll need the line `Require Import Arith.`.
### Hint: You can do `induction e` for the proof. Do not use `as` because it is tricky to get right.
### Hint: To find the names of the induction hypotheses, look at the assumptions given in the Context.
### Hint: The base cases can be solved by `reflexivity`.
### Hint: The recursive addition case can be solved by first rewriting backwards using `rewrite <-` the inductive hypotheses, and then finishing off with `destruct (optimize e1); destruct (optimize e2); hammer.`
