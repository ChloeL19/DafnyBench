1. Prove the base case: n = 0. Since the factorial of 0 is 1, it is clearly positive.

2. Prove the inductive step. Assume the factorial of n is positive. Then, the factorial of n + 1 is (n + 1) * factorial n, which is also positive because multiplication by a positive number preserves positivity and n + 1 > 0.
