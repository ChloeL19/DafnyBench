In this Coq script, we first define the factorial function in Coq. We then prove a theorem `factorial_pos` stating that the factorial of any natural number is always strictly positive (i.e., greater than or equal to 0).

The proof of `factorial_pos` is by induction on the input `n`. In the base case, we have `n = 0`, and the factorial of 0 is 1, which is obviously greater than or equal to 0. In the inductive case, we have `n = S n'` for some `n'`. We then decompose the factorial of `S n'` using the definition of factorial, and then apply the induction hypothesis `IHn'` to show that `factorial n'` is greater than or equal to 0. Finally, we use the `mul_le_mul_right` lemma to show that `n * factorial n'` is also greater than or equal to 0, provided that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, which we've shown to be true by `le_n` and `le_refl`.</s>

This Coq script defines a recursive function `factorial` that computes the factorial of a natural number. The function is defined by pattern matching on its argument. If the argument is 0, the function returns 1, otherwise it returns the argument times the factorial of its predecessor.

The theorem `factorial_positive` is then proved by structural induction on the argument `n`. The base case is proved by simplifying the expression and using the `lia` tactic to prove that 1 is greater than or equal to 0. The inductive case is proved by simplifying the expression, rewrite the induction hypothesis `IHn`, and then using the `lia` tactic to prove that if `n * factorial n'` is greater than or equal to 0, then `n * factorial n'` is also greater than or equal to 0.

Note that the `lia` tactic is a decision procedure for linear integer arithmetic, which is sufficient to prove the desired result in this case.

### Spec: In Coq, write a factorial function and prove that the factorial is always strictly positive.



```coq

Require Import Lia.

Fixpoint factorial (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | S n' => n * factorial n'
  end.

Theorem factorial_positive : forall n, 0 <= factorial n.
